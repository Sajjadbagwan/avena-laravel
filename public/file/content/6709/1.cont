	Pisces (19th Feb - 20th March) being the final and most mature of the star signs, indicates your spiritually developed character. The ruling symbol of your star sign is the fish and just as the fish lives in the ocean, so is Pisces suffused with feeling and empathy, the emotions that are characterised by water. The birthstone of Pisces is amethyst. With its rich purple colour, it is one of the most popular gemstones and is often used to aid soothing, healing and cleansing. It is said to be a powerful aid to creative thinking and spiritual awareness and is also believed to help combat insomnia. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their properties and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

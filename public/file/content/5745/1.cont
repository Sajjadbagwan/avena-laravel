	This hand painted baby watermelon shaped soap looks amazing and smells divine. &nbsp;The miniature soap is an alternative to a full sized one that would be just a bit too big to put on display in the home or to fit perfectly in your hand like this one does. The soap has all the characteristics of a full sized watermelon but its mini size makes it so much easier to use or to decorate with. These soaps are often used purely for decoration as they look so fabulous and can simply be placed in rooms to release&nbsp;their fragrance and look pretty. As this soap comes presented in a lovely box it would also be great to give as a gift. As the soap is hand painted with harmless food colouring, before the first use of the soap rinse it under warm water for 2-3 minutes, gently rubbing off the colouring. Then your pure natural soap is ready to use. If it is just being used purely for its decorative effect, if kept away from humidity your soap will continue to look beautiful for many years.</p>

	A set of three charming and fun handmade soap slices. Our sliced soaps contain a vegetable based glycerin meaning they are suitable for vegetarians but this also makes them mild with a neutral PH for a gentle cleanse. Each bar is a fun and quirky alternative to everyday soap that also contains natural essential oils to really benefit your skin and alter or enhance your mood. This fantastic set of soap slices can be given as a gift set or, as they are wrapped individually, can be split up and given out as individual gifts whilst even keeping some for yourself. Alternatively, they can all be kept for your own indulgence and we won&rsquo;t tell a soul! We will also include a special 25% off voucher which you can use on your next order or pass on if they are a gift. &copy; Please do not copy text.

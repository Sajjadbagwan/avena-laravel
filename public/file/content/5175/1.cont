	This bronze butterfly chime is made from genuine hardwood with&nbsp;a teak finish. It has six solid bronze rods with an antiqued copper-plated steel wind catcher. The wind catcher&rsquo;s scene recalls a lovely spring day. This chime easily inhabits both the&nbsp;indoors and outdoors and helps those in earshot to keep balance with their environment.&nbsp;The light and airy tones of this chime create a lively feeling and celebrate the variety of nature around us. This wonderful chime measures approximately 45cm long.&nbsp;</p>

	This wonderful suncatcher is ideal to hang in any window to truly show off its colours but also looks great on a wall or simply hung loose as a mobile. This delicate suncatcher is made with colourful letters spelling out the word &lsquo;Smile&rsquo; and is finished with a bright coloured flower. This lovely suncatcher measures approximately 14.5cm long from the hook on the top to the the bottom of the suncatcher. These suncatchers are great quality and are hand made on the island of Bali. Ethically traded: our supplier of this product is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. This finds its practical application in their dealings with their suppliers, customers and the environment. They give all their overseas suppliers a fair price, build real and lasting connections with them, monitor fair wages and good working conditions, minimise any environmental impact and use some of their profits to benefit the communities in which these products are made. An example of just one project is they donated &pound;5000 to rebuild Gejiadeng Primary School, a very old mountain school in Yunnan, which was in a dangerous state of disrepair. Building work on the school was completed in March 2008 providing the children with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a safe happy environment. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This beautiful piece is simply, and very aptly, named &lsquo;Motherhood&rsquo;. The mother fairy is lovingly lifting her youngster in what looks like both play and admiration. This charming pose represents caring, purity and most of all love. The detail is wonderful from the striking wing markings to the finer facial details and matching hair. The colours used are autumnal but the flowing dresses, flowers in their hair and barefoot figures also have a summery look about them. This beautiful fairy ornament stands at approximately 27cm tall and is 15cm x 7cm wide. It is carefully packed in a nice pictured box making it a lovely gift idea.</p>

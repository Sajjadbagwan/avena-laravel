	This white matte porcelain owl oil burner with star pattern cut outs looks great as it is but put it in a dark room with a tea light flickering inside to show how truly lovely it can look. The candle inside lights up the star shapes as the oils fill your room with a wonderful aroma. It&rsquo;s a great quality burner, is&nbsp;ethically traded and measures approximately15cm tall and 11cm across the base, so it&#39;s also a good-sized burner and would make a brilliant gift. Why not add some burning oils from our extensive range of fragrances <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/fragrance-oils/" target="_blank">here</a>?</p>

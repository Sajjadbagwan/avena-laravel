	This bath swirl is a chocoholic&rsquo;s dream, so take advantage and bathe in a chocolate ocean of love! The pure butters will moisturise your skin and the pure vetivert and black pepper oils will help make you less achy and more shaky! Dark cacao and caramelised sugar over a creamy base form the basis for this indulgent fragrance. Use your cocoa swirl up to four times by dropping it in the bath and allowing it to melt. Your cocoa swirl will fizz very softly releasing moisturising cocoa butter. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your cocoa swirl to dissolve and remove the rest from the bath to save it for later. Wash any petals away after use to prevent accidental staining of the bath.See our full range of Bath Blasters, Cocoa Swirls, Bath Tulips, Whoopie Blasters and more by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/bath-products/bath-bombs-melts/">HERE.</a></p>

	Kids and adults alike love sharks&#39; teeth and this fantastic necklace would make a cracking addition to an existing collection and would also make a fantastic accessory worn around the neck. This necklace is made up of brown and white beads and finished with an approximately 2cm long shark tooth in the middle. The shark tooth on this cool necklace is fossilised, and therefore came from sharks that lived and died many millions of years ago. They are mostly a by-product from phosphate mines and so have no connection with living sharks or the fishing industry. This shark tooth necklace measures L44cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	Place on a heat resistant surface. To avoid an enlarged or smoking flame, keep the wick trimmed to 5mm. Extinguish the candle when 5mm (1/4&#39;) of the wax remains. Ensure the candle is kept away from any flammable materials, draughts or any sources of heat (e.g. fires, TV&#39;s, radiators). Keep the wax free from any debris e.g. used matches/wick trimmings. Do not move the candle while alight or while the wax is molten. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Never leave a burning candle unattended.<br />

	Our bubble baths not only look sleek and stylish with a hint of humour in the personalised labels but a great deal on thought and care have gone into the making of each one. We use a rich organic foam base that is also SLS and paraben free. We then only ever use pure and natural essential oils to enhance and fragrance each one (we never use synthetic oils or perfumes) and all have a splash of vitamin E to finish. The fragrances range from the more feminine rose and lavender to what some say are masculine fragrances such as tea tree and eucalyptus as well as middle fragrances such as the tangy citrus or elegant and sensual ylang ylang that everybody seem to love. Each bubble bath is then hand poured into a stylish large 250ml dark blue bottle and topped off with a black cap, both of which are recyclable, meaning that the bubbles are good for you and the packaging is good for the environment. They may not be the cheapest bubble baths on the market but we have carefully selected everything to do with them before blending and bottling up each individual one meaning we can assure you that there&rsquo;s a little bit of Avena-love in every bottle and with the novelty labels they do make a lovely, very thoughtful and still affordable gift, especially with the mix and match offer of any 3 for &pound;19.99 (which can be mixed with other products in the offer). &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This selenite candle holder is absolutely stunning. It is carved into a beautiful ball shape with ridges around the outside adding to its lovely appearance and texture. This candle holder looks fantastic with a candle flickering within its deeply carved well. The white natural colour of the selenite glows from the inside creating a wonderful effect. The diameter of the candle holder is approximately 9cm and it stands at 9cm tall. Selenite or &lsquo;mineral Gypsum&rsquo; is found on large salt plains and is created just beneath the surface. The word Selenite comes from the Greek &lsquo;Selenites&rsquo; meaning moon stone or moon rock. Selenite is said to have many healing properties and is shaped and sold in many forms including candle holders, decorative towers and palmstones. This is a natural rough stone product that is not cut to any exact dimensions, meaning the shape and size of the item can vary slightly from the picture shown as could the colour, shade and/or pattern where applicable. We always choose the best quality stone products from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

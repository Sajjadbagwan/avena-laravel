	A wonderful dream catcher created from a Lisa Parker design showing the head of a wolf before a star symbol in the night sky. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them&nbsp;down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering from bad dreams, these wolf designs are now our best sellers. This dream catcher is approximately 103cm long from the hook to the bottom of the feathers and the actual picture has a diameter of approximately 35cm.&nbsp;</p>

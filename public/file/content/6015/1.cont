	This amazingly scented soap slice will make you surrender to the delights and foamy concoction of essential oils including ylang ylang and may chang, a spicy, lemony, citrus aroma known as an &#39;oil of tranquillity&#39;&nbsp;which will leave your senses tingling from head to toe.&nbsp;It has a sweet, zesty scent, opening with sparkling lemons, limes and green apples. The fresh heart of lily and lemongrass is balanced with creamy vanilla and soft musk. These soaps can be used like any normal bar of soap but they are much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with. Alternatively, rub the bar on a sponge.&nbsp;This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being handmade the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured.</p>

	This delightful cherub is cradled in cupped hands making it look very fragile and delicate. This beautiful ornament is made from resin and finished off in an off-white colour that gives it a marble effect. &nbsp;Cherubs are winged angelic beings and described in biblical tradition as attending on God. They represented in ancient Middle Eastern art as a loin or bull with eagles&rsquo; wings and a human face. Cherubs are regarded in traditional Christian angelology as an angel of the second highest order of the celestial hierarchy. Each of these gorgeous cherub figures measure approximately 14cm tall and come packed individually in a plain card box which makes it a lovely gift idea.</p>

	This cute looking green dragon incense cone burner has large eyes, enormous ears and large nostrils that seem out of proportion slightly, giving him a funny look. He is holding his hand to his chin and looking up&nbsp;as though&nbsp;he was posing for a picture. This comical incense cone burner is a fun way to burn your favourite incense. Simply place an incense cone in the base, light it and watch the smoke come out through the dragon&rsquo;s nose and mouth. The dragon is made of resin and measures approximately 16cm tall and 10cm wide.

	These Rose scented Goloka incense backflow cones come in a handy resealable tin. There are 24 cones in each tin with a burning time of approx 20 minutes per cone. These lavender incense cones can be used along with a backflow burner to create impressive smoke flow displays.<br />
	To use, simply light the tip of the cone with a lighter or taper, blow out the flame and allow the incense cone to smoulder and glow until releasing the smoke which is infused with the lovely scents, place the cone on an incense holder and enjoy the aromas throughout your home.&nbsp;</p>

	This blend of concentrated pure essential oils (including lemongrass, sandalwood amyris, geranium and lavender) is the perfect mix to make a natural, aerosol free and environmentally friendly room freshener with a truly wonderful aroma. Use in an oil burner, or as an alternative, simply use a clean empty trigger spray, (the type for kitchen or bathroom cleaner sprays) fill it with boiled and then cooled water and add 15 drops of the Avena Room Air Freshener. Shake the spray bottle well and hey presto, a natural air freshener. The small 10ml bottle contains roughly 200 drops so if used as recommended a bottle this size will re-fill your 500ml sprayer over thirteen times for only &pound;5.99 which is wonderful value for money. Containing only natural ingredients and not tested on animals we think you would struggle to find a better value for money, environmentally friendly, natural air freshener.</p>

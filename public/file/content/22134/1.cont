Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your wellbeing. Does it work?

	All our stones are of a fantastic quality, rich in colour, smooth and polished. The average stone is 20-30mm but this does vary slightly as each is a unique natural shape and they make a fantastic gift idea in our mini drawstring pouches. &copy; Please do not copy text.

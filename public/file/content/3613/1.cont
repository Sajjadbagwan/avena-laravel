	The toasted hazelnut range of candles have the most wonderful aroma. We had samples of these before we placed an order and the scent from them unlit and sat in the corner actually filled the room and had people commenting as they walked in. In a light and dark brown patterned style with a metal tag and leather type tie they are a truly great looking and quality candle. Medium pillar is 15cm tall and 7cm diameter.</p>

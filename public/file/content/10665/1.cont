	A beautiful natural stone Buddha cut from chrysocolla howlite which is a beautiful green/turquoise colour with a natural stone pattern throughout. Howlite is said to encourage fairness and clarity and is also believed to be good for teeth and bones. Buddha is the ultimate symbol of happiness, wealth and good fortune. Buddha&#39;s belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity and by stroking it, it is believed to bring much good luck. The laughing Buddha must always be invited into his new home, resulting in positive Chi bringing great happiness. Always place your Buddha in a position of honour and never on the floor. He can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office etc. but avoid bathrooms and toilets. Chrysocolla Howlite Buddha is 50mm tall and 50mm wide. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

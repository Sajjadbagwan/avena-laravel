	So what are the benefits of using natural beauty products? Your usual moisturiser may contain petrochemicals without you even knowing it!&nbsp;</p>
<div id="textpreview">
	In the fast paced modern world we live in, we all need to make an effort to stop and take time for ourselves, as everything we do has an impact on our health and wellbeing. While we walk around, going about our daily routine, most of us are subjected to exhaust fumes and pollution which clogs our pores. Even the food we eat has often been sprayed with pesticides, or processed in some other form; That&#39;s why its a great idea to choose natural products whenever you have the opportunity!<br />
	<br />
	Counteract some of the effects of modern living by using luxury beauty products with inspiration taken directly from Mother Nature. Creams which use natural carrier oils are far more beneficial for the skin than synthetic carriers which are derived from petrochemicals. In truth, a petrochemical base can result in skin irritation and drying, can be neurotoxic and result in allergic reactions. Generic petrochemical perfume has been suggested to cause headaches, mood swings and trigger asthma attacks. To avoid problems, read product labels carefully and steer clear from those without a natural base.<br />

	Our advice would be to use the wonderful array of <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/essential-oils/">aromatherapy</a> pure and blended oils now widely available. Simply gently massage into the skin to feel the full benefits. Some of the oils are blended with a <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/carrier-oils/">carrier oil</a> as some people prefer to dilute the oil before application. Aromatherapy oils are easy to keep in your bag for quick and easy access, you can apply them straight away with no fuss, a hand tip is to warm the oil in your hands beforehand prior to application.</div>

	Alternatively the oil can be inhaled using steam and used to clear your head and uplift your mood. It can then be used in a bath or even added to your favourite natural carrier cream such as cocoa butter. You can have fun experimenting with adding different oils to different creams, and creating different scents and textures.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	With all the chemicals our bodies are subjected to nowadays, it makes sense not to add to the burden unnecessarily. Choosing natural beauty and health products is an easy way to do this. Avoid petrochemicals and other synthetics and choose products from Mother Nature!</div>

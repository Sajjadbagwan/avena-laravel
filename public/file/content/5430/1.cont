	This wand is made from moss agate and is a rich green colour. Moss agate is considered the most powerful of the agates. It was the agate of warriors and is the agate that helps balance emotional energy. It helps the user to let go of anger and bitterness, so the emotions are balanced. Moss agate also enhances concentration, persistence, endurance and success and it is also a wealth stone. The pointed end of each wand directs the spell&#39;s energy. Wands can be wrapped in silver or copper wire with other gemstones to personalise&nbsp;them for different uses. Wands are popular healing tools, used to channel energy in reflexology and massage. The stone should be chosen for its particular benefits and energies. Crystal wands have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your wellbeing. These wands vary in lenght between 6cm and 8cm.</p>

	This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery&nbsp; the Moss Agate can vary from all shades of green to having streaks of white through them. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we will be happy to help.</p>

	Howlite is a beautiful turquoise colour with a natural stone pattern throughout. Howlite is said to eliminate rage and calm violent, uncontrolled anger. Turquoise howlite is believed to be good for teeth and bones and is also the birthstone of Scorpio (23rd Oct - 22nd Nov) and the symbol of protection. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our bracelets are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary from stone to stone and differ slightly from the image shown giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

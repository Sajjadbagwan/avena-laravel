	This fantastic fragrance oil is blended together with warm cinnamon and festive spices to help you infuse your home during the Christmas holidays. This wonderful bottle of fragrance oil smells and looks good, decorated with a woodland cottage it is the perfect addition to Christmas stockings or as part of a hamper and is ideal for use in oil burners, lamp rings, to drop onto potpourri or dried fruit to refresh a fading aroma. To use in oil burners fill the dish/well with water and add a few drops of oil; due to the quality of our oils 5-10 drops should suffice but you can add more for a stronger aroma. This Christmas Spice Cottage fragrance oil contains 10ml of the blend and comes packaged in a decorative card box. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This amethyst wand is a stunning crystal. Amethyst is known to be a very powerful stone that aids creative thinking, spiritual awareness and healing. It is also&nbsp;thought to help combat insomnia.&nbsp; Since ancient times, crystal wands have been used for healing by healers all over the world. Some believe that they were even used by crystal healers in Atlantis and they&nbsp;are still a common tool used by healers today. Wands come in many different shapes and sizes and also in many varieties of stone. Wands may be long or short and the cylinder can be smooth or faceted. They can be pointed at one end and rounded at the other, or they can be rounded on both ends, or pointed at both ends. Some wands are wider at one end and tapered at the other, whilst others are not. Most wands are shaped and polished. Healing wands gather and direct energy. The elongated, cylindrical shape of a wand enables the stone or crystal to direct its healing energy in a straight line, and the wand&#39;s point focuses the crystal&#39;s energy so that it can be used on specific areas of the body. &nbsp;Read our interesting history and uses of Amethyst blog by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/blog/2014/11/the-history-and-uses-of-amethyst/" target="_self">here.</a></p>

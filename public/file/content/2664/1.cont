	A careful blend of pure essential oils reputed to help with the symptoms of P.M.T. This is a compact blend of quality essential oils that are concentrated with no carrier oil added or diluted in any way. Only about five drops of this wonderful oil need to be added to a warm bath. To use pour the desired amount, we recommend at least 5 drops, into the bath under running warm water, mix in and then lay back and relax. When used in hot water, skin pores are opened allowing the essential oils to be rapidly absorbed. This concentrated bottle of P.M.T. bath oil contains 10ml which is roughly equivalent to 200 drops, so used at the recommended rate one bottle can average 40 baths, representing great value for money.</p>

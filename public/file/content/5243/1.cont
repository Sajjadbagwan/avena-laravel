	<span style="font-size: 12px;">A new and stylish way to fragrance any room. These stacks of sea urchins are crafted from a porous stone that absorbs any fragrance or essential oil. They are held upright by an inner rod but come apart easily (click item to see more images of one type apart) so that a fragrance or essential oil of your choice can be dropped into the base of each stone. The oil is then absorbed and slowly released into the atmosphere when the stones are put back together and placed in a room creating a unique, long lasting and environmentally friendly freshness. The stones look fantastic and can be used in the office, at home, at work and make a lovely gift. They come ready fragranced, which should last up to six months once opened from the protective wrap they are delivered in. You can then add your favourite oil or blend to refresh them meaning there&rsquo;s no fiddly refills or expensive top ups to buy.</span></p>

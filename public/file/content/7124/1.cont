	This unusual gothic style 3D notebook is designed by the popular artist Lisa Parker,&nbsp;illustrating dark, gothic and mainly black colours with the mysterious and sad fairy resting upon a silvery grey bubble. The cover page of this fantastic 3D effect notebook is made with layers of images topped with a clear lens coating that create the impression of depth in the picture.&nbsp;This stunning notebook would make the perfect idea paired up with one of our matching bookmarks.&nbsp;Please note that the reason the image is blurry is due to the item being 3D and hard to photograph. The actual image on the item is clear and great quality.&nbsp;</p>

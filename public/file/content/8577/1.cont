This decorative Himalayan salt lamp is approximately 20cm tall and 11cm wide and stands on a wooden base, weighing approximately 1.5-2kg; it also comes with all its accessories such as a plug and a light bulb. This is a natural rough stone product that is not cut to any exact dimensions, meaning the shape and size of the item can vary slightly from the picture shown as could the colour, shade and/or pattern where applicable. We always choose the best quality stone products from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash;Salt Lamp.</p>

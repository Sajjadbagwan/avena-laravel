	Agate is associated with healing properties. It is said to be the stone of balance and to be able to absorb negative energy. Agate is formed when the cavities in lava are filled with gas bubbles. As the lava solidifies, these gas bubbles fill up with water containing silica and alkali, finally coagulating into a gel. Palmstones are a great way to ease stress and aid relaxation. Made from a wide range of natural semi-precious stones they are cut into an oval shape approximately 70mm long x 50mm wide. They are then highly polished making them the perfect shape and texture to hold. Each with their unique properties they are also ideal to place under your pillow at night, use for meditation or chakra healing, simply to collect some wonderful semi-precious stones or as an ideal gift and are perfect for slipping inside a greetings card or one of our drawstring pouches.

We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item.

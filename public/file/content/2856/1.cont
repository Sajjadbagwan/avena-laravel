	These beautiful Ashleigh&nbsp;and Burwood&nbsp;De-Stress Synergies purple square tealight candles have a special blend of patchouli&nbsp;and ylang ylang essential oils whose energies and beneficial aromatherapy powers are delightfully enhanced by their union, creating a&nbsp;stressless aroma. The candles are unusual in that they are square in design and are beautifully purple coloured in crystalline wax, ideal for display in the home. Each tealight is made from 100% palm oil wax, which is taken from managed&nbsp;and sustainable palm plantations. A much more environmentally sound choice than paraffin wax, they are also much cleaner and longer burning. Each candle burns for approx&nbsp;five hours! Pack contains six tealights. Please note these candles are purple and not pink as in the image but are the same shape and size, we have sold out of the pink.</p>

	This fantastic gargoyle figurine is called&nbsp;&#39;Gnaw&#39;. He is made from a black stone look resin with gold features, giving him a brilliant fierce appearance. He has a stern look upon his face with his eyes in a piercing stare. He is crouched on a black round stone looking like he is watching something he is about to hunt, or he could even be warning something off. He has fantastic detail emphasizing the muscles in his arms, legs and chest and also showing off his strong sturdy wings. Gnaw is approximately 23cm tall and 14cm wide and would be a fantastic feature to add to any part of the house.</p>

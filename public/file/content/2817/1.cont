	This hessian peg bag is excellent quality and hard wearing. This range of The Baa Family products is top quality, delightful and this particular peg bag is embroidered with the wording &#39;&#39;Hand Wash Only&#39;&#39;. Maybe this is referring to the cheeky jumping sheep on the bag, which features a lovely green heart. A wooden coat hanger with metal hook completes the peg bag. Approx 50cm tall and 30cm wide.</p>

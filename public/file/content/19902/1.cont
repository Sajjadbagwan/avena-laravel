	Arnica (Arnica montana) is a wonderful homeopathic oil that may be used for injuries such as bruises, strained joints and aching muscles, ligaments and tendons. Arnica is probably best known as a natural oil that reduces the discoloration on bruises. When blood vessels are broken, blood escapes and comes to rest in the surrounding tissue. This trapped blood is responsible for black and blue bruise marks. Arnica may lighten these marks by helping the body reabsorb this trapped blood and ideal to treat your four-legged-friend be it a dog or a cat.</p>

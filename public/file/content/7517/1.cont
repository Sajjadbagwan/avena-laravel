	This fantastic looking skull has so much character about it, with its cracks, hollow features and realistic colours. This skull just gets better as it is finished with a black baseball cap decorated with silvery studs making out a skull with bones. The attention to detail and quality remains in the hat as well as in the skull. This cool ornament is made of quality resin and would make the perfect addition to an existing skull collection or as a gift to someone who is a lover of these creepy but decorative pieces. The skull measures approximately 13cm tall and 16cm x 10cm wide and comes packaged in polystyrene and a brown card box for safe shipping.</p>

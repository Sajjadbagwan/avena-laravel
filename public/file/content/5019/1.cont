	This dragonfly wind bell mobile is made from cast brass and aluminium with a verdigris finish. This traditional wind bell has clever dragonfly&nbsp;and bead accents. Areas that sustain life are called habitats, and each habitat is part of an interconnected system that makes the richness of our life on Earth possible, this design incorporates some of our favourite animals that reminds us of nature&rsquo;s habitats. The art of casting metal has been around for thousands of years. When heated to extremely high temperatures, metal will reach a molten state and can be poured into a mould. In this way, the ancients were able to create items of both enormous utility and great beauty. The same basic processes are used in foundries today. This wonderful chime hangs at approx. 50cm long and would make a lovely gift for someone special.</p>

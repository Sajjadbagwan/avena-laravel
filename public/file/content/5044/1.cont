	<span style="font-size: 12px;">These butterflies on sticks are a great way to add decoration and colour to spaces around your house inside and out. They are ideal for plant pots, flower beds, to add to dried flower arrangements and rockeries as well as adding to trees and shrubs, they can also be used on graves and memorials. They come in a pack of twelve and contain a range of patterns and bold colours. The butterflies are attached to a small spring at the top of the metal stick so they can move freely, making them appear to fly. Each butterfly stick is approximately 30cm tall.</span></p>

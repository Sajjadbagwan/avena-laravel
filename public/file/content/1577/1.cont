	A beautiful natural stone Buddha cut from amethyst which is said to aid soothing, healing and cleansing, it is still one of the most popular stones even though it is slightly more expensive than some others. The Buddha is highly polished and smooth to the touch. The Buddha is the ultimate symbol of happiness, wealth and good fortune. Buddha&#39;&#39;s belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity and by stroking it, it is believed to bring much good luck. The laughing Buddha must always be invited into his new home, resulting in positive Chi bringing great happiness. Always place your Buddha in a position of honour and never on the floor. He can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office etc. but avoid bathrooms and toilets. Amethyst Buddha is approx. 50mm tall and 50mm wide. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.

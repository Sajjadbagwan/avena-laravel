	A beautiful piece designed by Jody Bergsma of a blue and white winged fairy riding a magnificent unicorn. The detail, colour and design of this item are all wonderful . The fairy is holding the unicorns mane as he strides along over the rocks and swaying grass base. A great piece for any collector of unicorns or fairies. The solid piece weighs just under 1kg and is 185mm tall x 260mm long. She is packed in a very nice box making a great gift idea.</p>

Each one of these Yin Yang Soapstone Candle Holders is hand carved from Indian soapstone giving them all their own unique charm. A very solid and quite heavy piece in the ever popular Chinese Yin Yang symbol shape measuring 115mm across and 25mm high. Due to the hand made nature of these items sizes and exact colour may vary very slightly. Unfortunately the candles are not included with this candle holder.

	Buddha is the ultimate symbol of happiness, wealth and good fortune. Buddha&#39;s belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity and by stroking it, it is believed to bring much good luck. The laughing Buddha must always be invited into his new home, resulting in positive Chi bringing great happiness. Always place your Buddha in a position of honour and never on the floor. He can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office etc. but avoid bathrooms and toilets. This red twin laughing Buddha&#39;s piece is a great quality, solid and a quite heavy piece weighing about 400g. It is 60mm tall x 105mm long. He is also comes packed in a quality gift box and would make a lovely gift.</p>

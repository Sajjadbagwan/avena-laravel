	Tina is a hand painted fairy with purple wings. She is kneeling in grass surrounded by blossoming flowers and leaning on a toadstool. She is wearing a leaf skirt showing off a green tattoo down the top of her leg and has green ties up her arms, stopping just below her shoulder which shows another tattoo that goes over her shoulder onto the top of her back. This fairy has amazing detail from her hair and makeup to her wings and her surroundings. She measures 15cm tall x 14cm wide and&nbsp;comes carefully packed in a lovely picture box.&nbsp;</p>

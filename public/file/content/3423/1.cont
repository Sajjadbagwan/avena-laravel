	Regular users of Nag Champa will have used this natural blend already as it has been the free sample in standard packs of Nag Champa incense sticks for a while now. The fragrance is a mix of wild herbs and flowers. Satya Natural is meant to be filled with herbal, medicinal, healing and soothing properties. Nag Champa incense sticks are sold by weight, each box contains 15g of incense, about 14 sticks at 20cm long that normally burn for over an hour each. All our Nag Champa incense is the original Satya Agarbatti export quality (beware of imitations).</p>

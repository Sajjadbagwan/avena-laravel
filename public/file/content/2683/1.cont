Its beautiful colours and all the little details in his fir and shape and the vivid twinkle in his eyes make this fantastic ornament more realistic. This wonderful creature is made out if resin therefore it is water and frost resistant and would make a wonderful element of the garden just by sat next to a plant pot or put towards a lovely collection as well as put in the house or conservatory.

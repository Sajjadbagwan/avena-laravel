	A stunningly simple backflow incense burner in a black ceramic bamboo &amp; pool design. When the cone is lit the smoke from the cone cascades downwards in a mesmerising waterfall effect to pool at the bottom. Beautiful to watch. For best effects burn indoors in an area away from any sudden air movements. Please note that after burning it is normal for a light oily residue to appear on the oil burner, for this reason we recommend protecting any furniture it is placed upon suitably. The residue can be easily wiped off the burner with a damp cloth. Please exercise caution when burning incense.<br />
	Only backflow incense cones should be used with this product &ndash; standard incense cones will not create the desired effect. It is normal for cones to take up to 10 minutes after being lit to start creating the smoking/mist effect.&nbsp;<br />
	This burner measures at H10cm X W10.5 X D11cm</p>

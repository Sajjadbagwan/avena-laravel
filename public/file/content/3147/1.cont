These fantastic dragons are set on a rocky style base and are poised to start fighting. Made from quality resin this piece has been finished in a style that looks like a pencil drawing that has been made 3d with cross hatching details on the wings and the colours subtlety blending. The detail and finish is wonderful and it is quite a bit bigger than it looks. Dimensions: Height 19cm, Width 32cm. Each dragon is carefully packed in a box making a great gift idea.

This fantastic salt candle holder is a soothing and decorative way to help reduce allergens, moisture and indoor air pollutants and is also a must-have tool for people suffering from asthma. Himalayan salt is commonly known as rock salt and is mined in various regions at the foot of the Himalayas. The salt sometimes occurs in a reddish or pink colour with some crystals having off-white to transparent colour. This decorative salt candle holder is approximately 9cm tall and 10cm in diameter. This is a natural stone product, meaning the colour, shade and/or pattern of the item can vary slightly from the picture shown where applicable. We always choose the best quality stone products from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

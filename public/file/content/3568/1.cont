<p>A wonderful suncatcher that&rsquo;s ideal to hang in any window to truly show the colours and light but also looks great on a wall or simply hung loose as a mobile. These suncatchers are great quality and are hand made on the island of Bali. This item measures 130mm long. Ethically traded-&nbsp;Our supplier of this product is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. This finds its practical application in our dealings with their suppliers, customers and the environment. They give all their overseas suppliers a fair price, build real &amp; lasting connections with them, monitor fair wages &amp; good working conditions, minimise any environmental impact and use some of their profits to benefit the communities in which these products are made. An example of just one project is they recently donated &pound;5000 to rebuild Gejiadeng Primary School, a very old mountain school in Yunnan, which was in a dangerous state of disrepair. Building work on the school was completed in March 2008 providing the children with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a safe happy environment.</p>

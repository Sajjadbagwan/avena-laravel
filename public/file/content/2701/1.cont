	This Ashleigh &amp; Burwood reed diffuser is a great natural way to fill your home with a scent you love. For those who don&#39;t like burning incense or who prefer to be more eco friendly than using plug-in room fresheners a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting&nbsp;and stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. With normal use the liquid will last up to 4 months! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and sit back whilst the fragrance is absorbed through the stick and evaporates across your room. This scent of&nbsp;Ocean Breeze has&nbsp;a combination of marine and sparkling citrus notes of lime, lemon and orange. The aroma also contains&nbsp;orange blossom, soft jasmine and muguet,&nbsp;finished&nbsp;with base notes of dry cedarwood and soft musk.</p>

	This is Lemmee the endangered lemur. He is from the original &#39;YooHoo and Friends&#39; collection and is now fully microwavable. In just two minutes he is transformed into an extra snuggly and warm lemur to soothe, relax and comfort. He is grey and white in colour with large beady yellow eyes that are great for seeing during the night when he is mostly out and about, a button nose and a long grey and white stripy tail to help him balance. He is filled with treated millet and gently scented with lavender. YooHoo and Friends aim to spread the message to children about precious and endangered animals.&nbsp; Lemmee conforms to British safety standards and comes with his own instructions.&nbsp;</p>

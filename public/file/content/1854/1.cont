	This great little gadget is something that many people who use essential oils have been asking for and is one of those great yet simple ideas. To use simply add 2-3 drops of essential or fragrance oil to the white pad (5 included) and insert into the diffuser, then place the diffuser into the cigarette lighter outlet in your car and, after a moment, you will begin to smell the essential oils. The small light on the top of the diffuser will let you know when it is plugged in correctly. Suggested blends: to rid the car of cigarette odours, try 2-3 drops of lemongrass, patchouli or lime essential oils; to help with travel sickness use peppermint, ginger or a combination of both to relieve motion sickness and settle queasy stomachs; for long distance travel try some basil or lemon essential oils to stimulate the mind and help with awareness.</p>

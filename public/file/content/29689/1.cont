	This incense holder brings occult vibes into any room. Spirit boards have long been one of the most powerful occult tools there is. The background is black and has the alphabet marked out in a circle. A planchette sits in the centre and features the words YES and NO, below a small sun and moon, while the top and the bottom of the holder feature larger, more decorative suns and moons.</p>

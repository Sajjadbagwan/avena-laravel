	This stunning round, one-hooped traditional beaded dream catcher is decorated with purple coloured beads and finished with purple coloured feathers, measuring approximately 21cm long from the hook to the bottom feather.<br />
	Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams.<br />
	Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Dream catchers are very popular with children suffering bad dreams.<br />

	This lovely piece features three pebbles, one on top of another with the words peace, love and joy etched into them symbolising the qualities of life. The two cream coloured angels at the top of&nbsp;this tower are sitting beside a miniature tree. The base has a beautiful rippling water effect with pebbles and the colour and detail is wonderful. A thin metal ladder then comes up&nbsp;from the water to the top of the stone tower. Miniature trees have also grown out of the rocks adding to the natural feel of the piece. This lovely angel ornament would make a very special gift idea and comes securely packed in a polystyrene block within a sturdy box for safer shipping. The piece stands approximately 18cm high and is 12cm x 8cm wide.</p>

	These Tulasi extra-long garden incense sticks are ideal to use in any garden or open space. Allow the fresh and dewy aromas of citronella to fill the atmosphere and enhance evenings in the garden, conservatory, on the patio, camping or at a barbeque. Citronella is well-known for being an effective insect repellent, so they are perfect for those summer days and nights. They are great for inserting straight into the ground or can be stood in plant pots. These lovely garden incense sticks are approximately 42cm long and come in a pack of ten, packaged in a cardboard tube pack.&nbsp;</p>

	The storyteller fairy is a wonderful piece designed in the highest quality, from the brilliant colours throughout, down to the finest details such as the fairy&rsquo;s charming face, the grass and the patterns of the mushrooms. This beautiful looking fairy is wearing a pretty green dress and a cute flower clipped in her hair; she is sitting on top of a mushroom, her legs are crossed, and she&#39;s relaxing with a book resting on her arms. She is looking ahead as if her thoughts were somewhere far away in a land of dreams. Two grey hares are eagerly watching her and listening to the story that the book tells. All characters are resting on a base decorated with green grass and smaller mushrooms. This charming fairy would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of these butterfly-winged creatures or would make a lovely addition to an existing fairy collection. This fantastic work of art measures approximately 24cm tall and 15cm wide and comes packaged in polystyrene and a decorative card box for safe shipping.</p>

Our refreshingly fragrant, nourishing hand lotion can help to increase this feeling because it is infused with a blend of calming lemongrass and kaffir lime essential oils. Thais have long used the aromas of both herbs to improve their sense of well-being. Massage the lotion into your hands after washing, or as often as you like. This luxurious 250ml/8.45oz hand lotion is formulated without parabens, propylene glycol, petroleum derivative, silicone, synthetic colours and fragrances or animal ingredients.</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222; font-size: 9pt"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

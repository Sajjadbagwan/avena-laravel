	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This is Sly the gargoyle, he has been formed in a detailed grotesque design and finished with black and grey colours. This gargoyle is sitting down with his toes placed on each other and with one arm on his leg and another at his chin. His eye are peering to one side like he is watching something and waiting to make his next twisted move. He has two little horns and two wings with light coloured spikes running between them. He has bright white eyes with orange effect. He also has long grey nails and a tail that is curled up behind him. Sly will make a fantastic ornament in a garden next to a plant pot as well as put in the house or conservatory, by the fireplace or towards a collection. He is made of solid resin and is packed in polystyrene and his own box for safe transit. This ornament is approximately 10cm tall and 7cm wide. Sly would make the perfect gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures.</span></p>

	Jasper is a very useful stone for controlling the emotions and for soothing the nerves. This stone is said to encourage vitality and well-being. Red jasper is the birthstone for Libra (23rd September &ndash; 22nd October) and the symbol of energy. This gorgeous heart pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

	This crystal wind chime with chakra from Woodstock is made from a genuine hardwood with a white wash wood finish and heavy duty coated nylon strings, whilst the tubes are a special aluminium alloy that will not rust. This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance with coloured and clear crystal accent, making it as eye-catching as it is pleasing to the ear. &nbsp;A rainbow of crystals decorates this lovely chime with its fairy-like sound. If wind chimes were made in a magic land at the end of the rainbow, they would probably look something like this Woodstock chime.&nbsp;It is a delightful treat for any home or garden. This wonderful wind chime hangs approx. 25cm long.</p>

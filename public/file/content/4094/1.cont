	This is a stunning dragon figurine with fantastic blue and purple colours and a glitter finish. This piece is called &lsquo;Tyrus&rsquo; and is approx.10cm tall. He is sat on a rock/crystal base as if protecting his find. He is looking very grand with his wings expanded and mouth open like he is warning off any threats. Tyrus comes carefully packaged in his own box and would be the perfect idea for a little gift or even to treat yourself.</p>

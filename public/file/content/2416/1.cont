	These magnetic bracelets are really stunning. Made from magnetic hematite with wonderfully coloured cat&#39;s eye beads positioned in cut out sections of the hematite, they are very stylish with the subtle colour against the black hematite. They are elasticated to fit any wrist making them suitable for both men and women. The hematite is black and looks more like a metal then a mineral while the cat&#39;s eyes are coloured with a holographic effect. Often bought simply as stylish jewellery or for the great benefits of magno-therapy and make a stunning gift.</p>

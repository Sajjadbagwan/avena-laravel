	This garden gecko decoration is a fantastic life like stone effect copy of a real gecko as it is made with a lot of attention to detail, from the delicate eyes to the swirly tail, finished with a colourful floral effect which make this ornament very decorative. This fantastic ornament would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of geckos and would make a lovely addition to an existing gecko collection. As it was made for outdoors, it would also make a great decoration placed in the garden among flowers or by a plant pot, put on the patio or in the conservatory. This decorative gecko ornament is 35cm long and 19cm wide and comes packaged in a card box with polystyrene for safe shipping.</p>

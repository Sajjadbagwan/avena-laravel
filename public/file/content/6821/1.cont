	This fantastic Feng Shui chime from Woodstock is named after Earth one of the five elements within Feng Shui. It has five quality silver aluminium tubes and a black ash wood finish with a silk-screened wind catcher and genuine tigers&rsquo; eyestone accent. The chime hangs at 42cm long, so would be suitable for inside or outside use. The original musical scale for this chime was developed through chance by casting coins and referencing the I Ching. This chime is believed to help enable the positive flow of energy. So why not bring the energy of balance and nourishment into your life with the healing Feng Shui powers of the colour brown and Earth element?</p>

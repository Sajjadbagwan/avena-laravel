A set of two comical garden gnomes sat on mushrooms. Both with long white beards and coloured pointed hats. Made from resin with great detail and colour both gnomes come packed together in a decorative gift box and are 180mm tall. They make a wonderful and amusing addition to any house but are just as happy outdoors and would look great nestled between flowers, in a rockery, stood in plant pots or in the greenhouse/potting shed etc. Originally sold individually at £6.99 each they are now available at £9.99 for the pair.

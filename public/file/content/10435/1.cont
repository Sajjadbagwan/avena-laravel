	This beautiful natural stone is carved into a lovely heart shape and is a fantastic reddish/brown colour. This stone is mostly found in India, but can also be found in some states of South America. Carnelian is thought to be a healing stone as well as an energy booster, helping to build confidence and promote calmness, protecting from bad vibrations. The stone is also said to be the motivation stone in that it promotes creativity and motivates us to succeed. This carnelian heart is approximately 4cm x 4cm in size and comes in a small pouch. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

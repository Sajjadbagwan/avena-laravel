	This fantastic Buddha with Chinese dragon is one of our most popular Buddhas. It is made from quality resin and has been finished in a beautiful red, black and metallic gold paint. The detail and finish on this piece is wonderful and would make an ideal gift for anyone into Buddha or dragons. Remember to always place your Buddha in a position of honour and never on the floor. He can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office etc. but avoid bathrooms and toilets. Each Buddha and Chinese dragon comes carefully packed individually in a card box. Dimensions: Height 16cm. Width 11cm.</p>

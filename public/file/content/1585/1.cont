	Gemstone wands have been used since ancient times to increase the power of spells. The pointed end of each wand directs the spell energy. Wands can be wrapped in silver or copper wire with other gemstones to personalise it for different uses. Wands are popular healing tools, used to channel energy in reflexology and massage. The stone should be chosen for its particular benefits and energies. The frequency of amethyst is connected to the third eye, the crown and upper transpersonal chakras. It is often called the Crystal of Spirit and acts as a good meditation tool due to its resonance with the upper transpersonal chakras. To distress, hold the amethyst wand in the palm of the hand to absorb its calming vibrations. Placed under your pillow for a restful sleep free of nightmares or insomnia, the amethyst wand is also&nbsp;said to&nbsp;encourage prophetic dreams. Sizes may vary slightly. &nbsp;Read our interesting history and uses of Amethyst blog by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/blog/2014/11/the-history-and-uses-of-amethyst/" target="_self">here.</a></p>

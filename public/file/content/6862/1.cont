	A wonderful dream catcher featuring a black panther stalking along a tree branch. The scene is set in a forest at night with a moonlit mountain range in the background and an image of the panther&rsquo;s spirit in the night sky. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering these down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. They are very popular with children suffering bad dreams. This large dream catcher is approximately 80cm long from the hook to the bottom feather and the actual picture has a diameter of approximately 32cm.</p>

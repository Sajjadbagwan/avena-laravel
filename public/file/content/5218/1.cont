	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This medium round owl is the mother from our family set of three. She has a wonderful cartoon look about her and looks very happy if not a little startled too. She has wide adorable eyes and her cute beak is open showing her pink tongue. She is light brown in colour with a white chest, has feathers for each of her eyebrows and wings, detailed feet with claws and a tuft of tail feathers. Made from quality resin she is suitable for outdoor use as part of our garden range (although we recommend that she is not left out during harsh, frosty weather and very bad winters) but she also makes a lovely indoors ornament and great gift idea individually or as part of the set. This owl measures at 14cm tall and 17cm wide.</span></p>

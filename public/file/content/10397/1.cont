	Cold pressed flaxseed oil is made from the seeds of a flax plant (Linum usitatissimum) and is also known as linseed oil, but there is a common misconception that the two oils are the same. Technically they are but in terms of the process they go through they are very different. Linseed Oil goes through a different manufacturing process (expeller) and is mainly used in animal and chemical manufacturing. It can be used in cosmetics but it&rsquo;s basically the cheaper/ lower grade version of flax.</p>

	Our flaxseed oil is 100% Yorkshire grown (in The Dales) and then cold pressed in Goole. This makes it cosmetic grade flax and it is widely used in aromatherapy.</p>

	Flaxseed oil contains both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids making it a very healthy oil. It also contains the essential fatty acid alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), which the body converts into eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Omega-3 fats are said to protect the body from numerous ailments, including heart disease, hypertension and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis.<br />

	This brilliant owl garden ornament is made out of solid resin, is water and frost resistant and would make a lovely element in a garden next to a plant pot or nestled between flowers, but being so unusual and decorative it would be a great decoration in the house, office or conservatory. Each owl is unique as they are all made of different shapes of rock and with detailed design of their eyes, simple brown colours and a natural cream finish these owls are perfect for home decoration. These lovely garden owls are approx. 11cm wide and 12cm tall and are a great gift ideal for someone who loves nature`s little creatures.&nbsp;</p>

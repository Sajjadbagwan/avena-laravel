			Relax with quality as standard</h3>
		<p>
			Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils mixed with other fragranced natural plant material to enhance mood, improve health and help to clear the mind and aid relaxation. Here at Avena we sell an extensive A-Z range of 100% pure, top quality essential oils as well as fragrance oils and massage oils so that you can choose the fragrance that best suits your needs. &nbsp;We also stock top quality base products and carrier oils from borage oil to bubble bath base.</p>

			Amazing natural products</h3>
		<p>
			For those of you troubled by skin complaints we carry a sizeable range of products to help ease the symptoms of eczema and psoriasis, including Body Itch Bath Oil that&rsquo;s widely used by eczema sufferers and Lichen Planus Massage Oil to relieve the irritation of Lichen Planus. As well as this we have a range of products to help relieve the symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism including Active Life Cream which is our flagship product that has provided amazing natural arthritis pain relief in the UK for many years. The unique formula was developed after several years&rsquo; experimentation, with benefits being refined and enhanced throughout hundreds of individual tests. At the heart of the cream is a nutrient-rich fusion of three herbs, seven pure essential oils and eleven herbal extracts.</p>

		A brilliant example of natural beauty</h3>
	<p>
		In our range of natural beauty products we have some lovely oils which are ready to use straight on the skin, some wonderful hand, face and body creams as well as hair products.&nbsp; We also have a range of natural grooming products for men that work wonderfully and smell fabulous. When developing our beauty products we took advice from Mother Nature by using 100% natural and fresh ingredients.&nbsp; OurDry Skin Cream is one of the best selling products in the range and has been described as a brilliant example of a natural beauty product by our customers.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve also created Funky Feet Foot Balm &ndash; perfect for easing tired, aching feet after either a long day on your feet or a long night of dancing in gorgeous shoes. I know about one of these&hellip; I&rsquo;ll let you decide which! Many people use the oils we sell in oil burners or on pot pourri, but there are so many uses for them it&rsquo;s impossible to list them all. For example our aniseed essential oil is an unusual enhancement when added to fishing tackle!&nbsp; There are also great benefits when oils are added to the bath which is why we developed our sports range which includes bath oils and muscle rubs.</p>

			For the animal lovers</h3>
		<p>
			We&rsquo;ve also added a range for non-human customers - canine, feline, bovine and equine as opposed to alien!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen an increase in sales of our natural animal remedies to farms, stables and liveries throughout Europe in the past few years and can see that our customers would rather use natural remedies on their animals than anything containing harsh chemicals.&nbsp; This is a really diverse range that includes, amongst others, Natural Animal Fly &amp; Midge Spray, Masticare Udder and Teat Oil, Horse &amp; Pony Natural (MUDF) Ointment and Dog and Cat Natural Arnica Oil.</p>

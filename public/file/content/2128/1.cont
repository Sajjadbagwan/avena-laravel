	This baby hedgehog is made out of resin therefore it is water and frost resistant. This little creature is sitting on his back legs, looking ahead with a cute smile on his face. Its vivid colours, the details of his fir and spikes and the twinkle in his eyes make this lovely hedgehog more realistic. The lovely ornament would make a lovely element of the garden sat next to a plant pot or put towards a nice collection as well as sat inside the house or in a conservatory. This fantastic hedgehog is approx. 13cm long and 10 cm tall and would make a wonderful gift for someone who loves nature`s little creatures.</p>

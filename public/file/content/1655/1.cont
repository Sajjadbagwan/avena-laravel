	A beautiful natural stone Chinese dragon cut from blue howlite which is said to be a super-calming stone and many people use it to relieve stress of all kinds. Focusing on a piece of howlite can assist in journeying outside the body and gaining insight from past lives. Placed in a pocket or worn as jewellery blue howlite can absorb your own anger - or another&#39;s anger that is directed toward you. It helps to overcome critical or selfish behaviour. The Chinese dragon is a very popular figure and this polished blue howlite one sells very well in our shop. The dragon is 60mm long x 42mm tall.</p>

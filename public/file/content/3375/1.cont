<p>A lot of our magnetic bracelets, necklaces and earrings are often bought simply as stylish jewellery but with the great benefits of Magno-Therapy been recognised and increasingly popular this range of jewellery is a stylish way to reap these wonderful benefits. Did you know that there is a strange mystical force that actually surrounds planet earth that no-one can fully explain, that can be used to move objects remotely, that Cleopatra utilised to keep her beauty intact, that many today believe helps and enables the human body to fight aging and help renewal. Chinese call it Chi, the Indians know it as Prana. Whatever you choose to call it, this amazing energy is a basic force of life-it pulses throughout the galaxies and is found everywhere in nature. The ancient Egyptians were also acquainted with the power of magnets. Legend has it that Cleopatra slept with a magnetic stone on her forehead to preserve her youthful appearance. The ancient Hindus in India believed that a dying person should rest with their body aligned north and south (their head pointed north) to relieve their pain and ease their departure from this life. Even Aristotle spoke about using magnets as a healing therapy so you can see that magnets have a very long and worldwide pedigree. Like so much ancient wisdom that the modern world deemed as hocus-pocus (like aromatherapy) Magnetic Therapy is being taken very seriously. Magnet therapy (or Magno-Therapy) is a natural way to treat a wide variety of ailments. It is 100% safe, drug free and has no side effects. It works well as a therapy, either alone or in conjunction with both natural and conventional therapies. Small high strength healing earth magnets are placed on the body, usually in the form of jewellery.  How does it work ? Not everyone agrees, but here is one of the more popular theories: The earth possesses a natural magnetic energy field, which we apparently require to function normally. With a modern lifestyle, we are limiting the amount of natural magnetic energy that the body absorbs and polluting our magnetic field with modern devices such as mobile phones etc. This natural energy helps to release endorphins into the blood stream which is our natural pain killer. Magnetic therapy products such as jewellery, replaces this energy to our system and can decrease pain up to 70%. Magnets also stimulate the blood circulation and increase the blood flow through the heart. This results in increased oxygen to the organs and tissues. Users of magnetic jewellery have claimed that it can help with the following ailments- Migraine &amp; Headaches, Muscular Pain, Joint Pain, Respiration Problems, Back Pain, Digestive Problems, Arthritis, Period Pain, Rheumatism, Phlebitis, Poor Circulation, Varicose Veins, Stress &amp; Anxiety, Insomnia, Sciatica plus plenty more.</p>

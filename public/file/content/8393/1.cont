	This stunning mirror box is made of composite wood and covered in fabric with a velvet effect material with velvet underside. The art work on this charming box is a design by Lisa Parker, showing the face of a blue eyed wolf over a golden brown coloured pentagram, filled with a background of stars and winter forests all surrounded by a hazy night blue sky. The 7cm x 7cm wide mirror and the black velvet cover on the inside of the box make it a fantastic accessory to store jewellery, hair accessories or make up etc. This fantastic wolf mirror box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of wolves or would make a great addition to an existing wolf collection. The box measures 10cm x 10cm wide and comes in a decorative card box.</p>

	This stunning multi-coloured dream catcher is made up of five round hoops and instead of feathers it is decorated with colourful shell circles and square pieces of mirrors. This fantastic dream catcher would make the perfect decoration hung above a bed, in the window or on the wall and would make a wonderful addition to any room of the home including hallways, bedroom, living room and kitchen. This wonderful rainbow dream catcher would make a cracking present idea for someone who is a sufferer of nightmares and would make a lovely addition to an existing dream catcher collection. This fabulous rainbow dream catcher measures approximately 45cm long from the hook to the bottom shell. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Dream catchers are very popular with children suffering bad dreams. &copy; Please do not copy text.

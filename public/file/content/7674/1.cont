	This charming Christmas wooden hanger was designed to look like a bauble although it is flat. This bauble hanger is painted red and decorated with a red and white tartan bow and letters reading &lsquo;Snow better friend than you HAPPY CHRISTMAS&rsquo;. The black wire loop at the top makes it easy to hang the bauble up anywhere in your home including door handles, windows, garden gate and mantelpiece or even on the Christmas tree and would make a lovely addition attached to a present as a gift tag for that extra special touch. This cute bauble Christmas hanger is 7.5cm diameter and 0.5cm wide.</p>

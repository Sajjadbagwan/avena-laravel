	These highly polished &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade tumblestones are crafted from natural stone and come packaged in a large, black drawstring pouch, making it the perfect gift idea for any occasion. The whole lot can be given as a gift set or as they are individual pieces, they can be split up and given out as individual gifts while keeping some for yourself. Alternatively they can all be kept for your own entertainment and we won&rsquo;t tell anyone. We will also include a special 25% off voucher which you can use on your next order or pass on if they are a gift.</p>

	Labradorite stones are very popular for their wonderful deep colours and varied patterns. Each one is unique and may differ slightly from the image here but this is why they are so sought after. This stone is said to aid many medical complaints from high blood pressure and gout to colds and flu. It is known as a stone of understanding, wisdom and truth and can aid good judgement under pressure keeping you calm and in control. It is also said to increase intellect and wisdom.</p>
<p>
	We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. The average size for each tumblestone is approximately 2cm long.</p>

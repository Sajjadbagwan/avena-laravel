	There is perhaps no better natural insect repellant in the world than that which can be found as an active ingredient in the essential oil known as citronella. Most of us are extremely familiar with the strong odour that this substance emits; a smell that is particularly disagreeable to pesky insects such as mosquitoes and bees. Although citronella is quite popular in its waxy form as a candle, there are indeed other uses for this truly remarkable plant.</p>
<p>
	For example, when used with a binding agent, citronella soap is an excellent deodorant as well as a mild antiseptic. Its natural properties make it ideal for those with skin that may be sensitive to artificial chemicals in commercially produced soaps. Still, there are other internal uses that many consumers may not be aware of. Citronella essential oil can be used to treat a number of afflictions that include, headaches, fevers, muscular aches (particularly those in the lower back), Intestinal disorders, the treatment of low-grade fevers.</p>
<p>
	However, it should be noted that those with sensitive skin may become irritated and it is for this reason that citronella oil is often diluted when used topically.</p>

	Due to the fact that <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Citronella-Essential-Oil-Cymbopogon-Nardus/">citronella</a> is most commonly used as an effective insecticide, it makes sense to take a look at a popular recipe for its indoor and outdoor use. The acrid, lemony smell of citronella can be modified by mixing it with equal parts of <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Lavender-Essential-Oil-Lavandula-angustifolia/">lavender</a> and <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Clove-Essential-Oil-Syzygium-Aromaticum/">clove</a> oil. A popular recipe will be five drops of each. The resultant smell is considered by many to be mild and spicy; ideal for those who may be a bit sensitive to what can sometimes be considered a rather acrid odour. Nonetheless, this mixture will prove to be just as useful at repelling insects and other small pests.</p>

	A fantastic and safe alternative to the traditional hot water bottle. This wonderful bottle shaped warmer is manufactured in a luxurious high quality fabric that is wonderfully soft to the touch. It is filled with a new improved organic filling material with a hint of French Lavender. To heat, simply place in a microwave for two minutes (no need for boiling water) to then slowly release soothing heat and a relaxing aroma while keeping you warm in bed or snuggled up on the sofa on those winter evenings. These bottle shaped warmers are not just for winter though and are ideal for aches and pains or when feeling unwell and are great for adults or kids. Click the product title for more images.</p>

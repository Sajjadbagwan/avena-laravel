	Dear Sir</p>
<p>
	I recently purchased my second jar of Active Life cream. I thought I would take the time to write to let you know how fantastic the cream is but also how helpful the lady in the shop was. I needed the cream urgently before we flew on holiday and so I called to order. The lady who took my order upgraded it to First Class (free of charge) and even said she would try to get in that days post. I received the cream in plenty of time and will be back for more when this has run out. Thank you for the lovely customer service.</p>
<p>
	Kind regards&nbsp;</p>

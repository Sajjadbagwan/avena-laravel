	William the Strong Knight is full of character. He would make a great gift to add to any fantasy collection or can even be the start of a collection himself. William stands proud and fearless at 8cm tall and 4cm wide. He is wearing a coloured centre piece of armour over his torso with metal armour covering his arms and legs and a helmet protecting his head as well as the back of his neck. He has a very angry expression on his face and looks like he is preparing for enemies already approaching. He is very ready to fight and very determined not to be defeated.</p>

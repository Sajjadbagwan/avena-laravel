Alcohol is the most popular extractant for use with black cohosh and helps give it a longer shelf-life. Black cohosh has been used by native North American Indians in their traditional medicine practices for various purposes, including amenorrhea and menopause. In the United States there is evidence of the use of this herbal preparation for more than 100 years for gynaecological complaints. Several studies in humans suggest that black cohosh may be safe and effective for improving symptoms of menopause, such as hot flushes, migraine headache and sleep disturbances. Black cohosh has been used as an agent for pain and inflammation in Korean folk medicine. Other research suggests that herbal preparations containing black cohosh may improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Herb:Alcohol ratio =&nbsp;1:3.</p>

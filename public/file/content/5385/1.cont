	Catch a refreshing uplifting apple scent and luxuriate in the soothing cocoa and shea moisturising loveliness. Containing&nbsp;pure amyris and nutmeg essential oils to warm, calm and refresh, with a mouth-watering crunchy apple scent. You can use your bath tulip up to four times by dropping it in the bath and allowing a portion of it to melt. Your bath tulip will fizz very softly releasing moisturising cocoa butter and essential oils. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your tulip to dissolve and remove it from the bath to save the rest for later. Wash any petals away after use to prevent accidental staining of the bath.&nbsp;This bath tulip is also suitable for vegans.

	A beautifully designed wooden incense cone burner. Light and dark wood is used to create the diamonds on this temple house hinged style of cone burner. The hinged lid opens to reveal the brass burning well to sit your smoking incense cone in. You can then close the lid and let the smoke and fragrance escape through the fretwork pattern within the lid. Approx 155mm in height. A stunning piece for any room in the house and a lovely gift.</p>

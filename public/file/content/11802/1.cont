Throughout the day, the moisturiser helps hydrate and protect the skin against the effects of dehydration. Our fantastic Face Cream for Men is blended together using pure essential oils reputed to help skin look healthier and fresher, discourage tired-looking lines under the eyes, refresh and relieve taut, dry skin, replenish tender just shaved skin, improve skin complexion and tone, improve shaving rashes and help prevent in-growing hairs. Our Face Cream for Men contains a base of polysorbate 20 which has a soothing effect on your skin; cetearyl alcohol which is well known to effectively condition and soften the skin; glyceryl stearate (derived from palm kernel, vegetable or soy oil and also found naturally in the human body) which penetrates the skin and slows the loss of water from the skin by forming a barrier on the skin&rsquo;s surface; phenoxyethanol which is used in many natural creams as a preservative and an alternative to parabens; water to moisturise your skin and a drop of enriching vitamin-E oil. The cream base is then carefully blended together with natural and pure essential oil of frankincense which is great for toning and refreshing the skin and is used in many creams and lotions.

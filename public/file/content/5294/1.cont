	This stunning dragon skull makes a fantastic ornamental piece for any dragon fan due to its amazing detail but can also be used as an incense burner. Each piece is made from white resin giving&nbsp;them a bone coloured appearance, with a darker wash adding detail and shading, particularly to the horns. The top of the skull has been carved to create a slight ridge from the tip of the nose up to the top of the skull, so that if and when used as an incense burner the ash will be caught within this space. Each dragon incense burner comes packed individually in a card box and measures 22cm long, 9cm tall and 7.5cm wide.</p>

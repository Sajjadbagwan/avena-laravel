	Orthoceras are fossils found in the High Atlas mountains of Morocco and are 400 million years old. The distinctive bullet-like shell was once divided into gas-filled chambers which kept the creature buoyant in the water. These are now fossilised in black limestone and often found in clusters as in this piece. These are genuine fossils and each decorative piece is unique. The approximate height is 21cm and they are heavy pieces weighing around 1.5kg.</p>

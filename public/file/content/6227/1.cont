	<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/essential-oils/">Essential oils</a>, the distinctive liquids that come from plants, have long been heralded as highly beneficial for your health and body and are increasingly used as treatments in the medical realm. Their uses differ considerably, with some oils being used for skin care and others being used for serious health conditions, such as cancer. <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Eucalyptus-Pure-Essential-Oil-Eucalptus-globulus/">Eucalyptus oil</a>, <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/rose-absolute-essential-oil-absolute-pure-rose-centifolia-oil-rosa-centifolia/">rose oil</a> and <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Lavender-Essential-Oil-Lavandula-angustifolia/">lavender essential oil</a> are amongst the most widely used and best known essential oils across the world.</p>

	So, just how do these magical oils work? There are different ways essential oils can be used and in which they enter our bodies. The liquid can either be applied to the skin, ingested (only a selected few oils can be ingested - check with a registered aromatherapy professional), or inhaled, and there are lots of different kinds of essential oils which serve various purposes. When inhaled, the oils go via our lungs to pass into the blood stream, or simply send signals to our brain by triggering the nervous system. This is the easiest and quickest way to absorb the oils.</p>

	Another method is by applying them to the skin through methods such as massage which allows them to be gradually worked into the body. Only certain oils can be applied directly to the skin and the majority of oils will have to be added to a carrier oil before applied directly to the skin. It is always wise to check with a specialist to establish which oils are safe.&nbsp;</p>

	Essential oils are made up of tiny molecules that, due to their small, compact size, can get into each and every cell in the body and work their magic. Unlike regular oils, these oils are at their very core designed to do just this, and so when we apply or inhale them, they are simply fulfilling their natural purpose in the only way they know how. Scientific research has found that they penetrate the skin and can even restructure the cells they enter, curing and assisting certain ailments in the process.</p>

	They can also effect the human nervous system, and many essential oils positively impact the brain, often de-stressing the patient. Essential oils like <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/chamomile-german-blue-essential-oil-matricaria-chamomilla/2/">Chamomile</a> and <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Lavender-Essential-Oil-Lavandula-angustifolia/">Lavender</a> have been successful in relieving those who are suffering from depression, anxiety or insomnia, and are subsequently a popular choice of natural remedy.&nbsp;</p>

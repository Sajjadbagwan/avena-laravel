	This fantastic table has already had some fantastic comments and admiration from customers who have seen it. The ghostly base is quite amazing and the detail superb with smaller &lsquo;scream like&rsquo; faces in the spectres eerie cloak. The table base is approximately 46cm tall, 31cm from front to back and 41cm wide. The round glass base has a diameter of 58cm. There are three small suckers on the spectre base that hold the glass top safely in place. Each table comes carefully packed in two boxes (the glass top and base) to ensure safe delivery which is free on this product but please note we only offer this for sale to UK mainland customers due to the size.

	A wonderful dream catcher created from a Lisa Parker design showing a beautifully detailed white unicorn head with a prominent horn standing out against the blue background of the lake and clouded, starry night sky. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. They are very popular with children suffering from bad dreams. The dream catcher is approximately 73cm long from the hook to the bottom of the feathers and the actual picture has a diameter of approximately 21cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

Each note in this scale has specific healing properties and this recording uses the third note, which resonates to a frequency of 528hz and is associated with the colour gold and the element of fire. This frequency is described as the love frequency as it has the potential to bring about transformation and create miracles as well as repairing broken DNA. It can also help to overcome problems like fatigue, anxiety, control issues and negative thought patterns, all of which exist within the same vibrational energy. Glenn Harrold&#39;s skilled vocal delivery and guided meditation combined with Ali Calderwood&#39;s deep and moving soundscapes tuned to 528hz combine to create an amazingly powerful meditation recording. By combining these sounds with a guided meditation, you also have the potential to release deep-rooted blockages. These compositions also contain an array of sacred instruments and sounds such as crystal bowls and didgeridoo and sacred chants, which work to further enhance the effects of the solfeggio tones.</span></p>

	This amazing multi-coloured glass disc mobile is a fantastic decoration of the house or conservatory in the summer. When put in the window the glass discs catch the sunlight and in their colours reflect it to the area creating a magically colourful atmosphere. This lovely mobile has grey wave shaped base with six strings, four of them with beautiful round and rectangular discs and two of them with just round discs at the bottom but all of them are made in a colourful mosaic effect. The discs make a lovely tinkle sound when touching and is a beautiful gift idea. The mobile is approx. 25cm wide and the strings with the discs are approx. 41cm long.</p>

	This fantastic looking crystal twister comes with an eye-catching 3D image of a hummingbird and two glass ball insets completed with a string and hook making it the perfect accessory for any garden, patio or conservatory. This mesmerising spiral mobile is easy to assemble, simply hook the spiral tail into the hole at the bottom of the humming bird spinner, find the perfect spot for it and leave the rest to the wind! The wind spiral is made from quality stainless steel that will not rust or tarnish whilst outside. To keep it maintained it may just require an occasional light wash with rust proof window or stainless steel cleanser. As this spiral twists in the wind, when in motion, the hummingbird appears to be flying while the balls appear to travel up and down the tail creating a hypnotising illusion. The hummingbird spinner measures approximately 16cm diameter and with the string and the spiral the whole mobile measures approximately 58cm long. This wonderful crystal twister comes packaged in a decorative box. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Spiral with 3D Hummingbird Crystal Twister.</p>

	<span style="line-height: 17.77px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0,0,0)">This fantastic piece is full of character. It consists of three stone faces stacked on top of each other starting with the largest at the bottom to the smallest on the top. Each of the faces has a different expression, but all look ever so cheeky with their beady eyes, round cheeks and huge grins -&nbsp;you can&rsquo;t help but love them! This stack of heads&nbsp;is made from a quality resin with a weathered stone wash finish and is suitable for outdoor use as well as indoor, however we don&#39;t recommend leaving them outside during severe winter conditions. It would be a great addition to any garden, patio, or why not even place it on a windowsill or in a conservatory? This stack of three heads is hollow and lightweight, and is approximately 11cm wide and 21cm tall.&nbsp;</span></p>

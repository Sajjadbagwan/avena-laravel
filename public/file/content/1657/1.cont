	Onyx is a lovely stone that is said to aid determination, self control, stamina and strength. Pendulums have been used in dowsing or radiesthesia which is believed to date back over six thousand years. The Egyptians and ancient Chinese were early practitioners. Crystal dowsing can be performed in many ways and it is claimed for all sorts of purposes, such as finding water, minerals, missing people and even lost objects. It is also used in healing, reiki and divination. Fitted with a silver chain approx 170mm long, gemstone bead at the top end and a beautiful sphere blue onyx at the other this pendulum really does have something quite magical about it and can be hung in any room, window or used as a jewellery piece.&nbsp;</p>

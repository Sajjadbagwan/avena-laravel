	This cute little white dream catcher is decorated with red, black and white coconut beads and finished with beautiful undyed feathers at the bottom. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Dream catchers are very popular with children suffering bad dreams, meaning this miniature dream catcher is perfect for hanging over your little dreamer&#39;s bed or cot. Measures H22cm from the top of the hook to the bottom feathers x W6cm in diameter. &copy; Please do not copy text.

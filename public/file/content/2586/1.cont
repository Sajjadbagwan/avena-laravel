	Orthoceras are fossils found in the High Atlas mountains of Morocco and are 400 million years old. The distinctive bullet-like shell was once divided into gas-filled chambers which kept the creature buoyant in the water. These are now fossilised in black limestone and often shaped and polished into decorative pieces such as these eggs. These are genuine fossils and each decorative egg&nbsp;is a unique fossil. They are 6.5cm tall and are solid, weighing 200g each.</p>

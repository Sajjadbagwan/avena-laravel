	This decorative and modern looking fragrance lamp is a brilliant way to eliminate odours, purify the air in the room or just gently fragrance any room in the house. It is easy to use, just fill the diffuser lamp with Ashleigh &amp; Burwood unique fragrance oil, insert the stone assembly and cover the stone with the snuffer-cap leaving it for 20-30 minutes to allow the wick to soak in the oil. Remove the cap and light the stone leaving it to burn for two minutes, then blow out the light and cover the stone with the decorative lid and let the lamp fragrance the area. To prevent the fragrance from evaporating when not in use, just remove the decorative lid and cover it with the snuffer-cap. Once the oil is used up, it can be swapped for another fragrance oil from Ashleigh &amp; Burwood. The lamp can be easily cleaned with glass cleaner. This beautiful lamp is in a leopard design and is approx. 12cm tall. It comes in an elegant gift box and is a perfect gift for anyone with a good taste&nbsp;for home fragrancing. Please read enclosed instructions before use.</p>

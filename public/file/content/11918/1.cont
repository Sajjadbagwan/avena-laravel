	This stunning canvas picture is a splendid modern way to hang a great piece of art on a wall without the unnecessary bulk of a frame. This stunning piece is designed by Anne Stokes and features the greatly popular &#39;Angel Spirit Guide&#39; picture, printed onto a polymer canvas material and wrapped around a small wooden frame. The artwork consists of a female angel with long flowing brown hair, clad in a long white gown; growing from her back are a pair of white angel wings. The attention to detail in this wonderful picture is phenomenal, down to each feather that makes up the wings. The beautiful angel is standing on a shoreline where the ocean meets the sand, whilst the peaceful blue of the sea merges with the mist-adorned serenity of a morning sky. This decorative canvas can be hung anywhere from the bedroom to the living room. Perfect if you&#39;re a fan of angels or if you&#39;re looking for a special gift for any occasion. This fantastic picture canvas measures H25cm x W19cm x D1cm and this item also features on our 2 for &pound;9.99 range! &copy; Please do not copy text.

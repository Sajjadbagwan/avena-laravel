	<span style="font-size: 12px">Enjoy the beautiful results of natural history with this pair of genuine ammonite fossils. Our Hildoceras ammonite fossils are cut and polished making them ideal for display in the home or a wonderful gift idea. They show the spiral shell of the ammonite in great detail and it&rsquo;s amazing to think that these are from approximately 175 million years ago. Hildoceras ammonite fossils come from the Lower Jurassic period. These creatures resembled the modern squid, but lived protected in their beautiful shells which are now fossilised giving you the chance to own a piece of history. Each fossil is approximately 3cm and the price is for two fossils sent in a clear plastic pack.</span></p>

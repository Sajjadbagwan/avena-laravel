	<span style="font-size: 12px">This fantastic mini elephant is carved from onyx with a polished finish and smooth touch. The elephant is free standing and measures 3cms high. Onyx is formed over thousands of years, mostly in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains. Onyx forms in parallel bands with a variety of colours, mainly greens and browns, and it is often used for carving.&nbsp;</span>Please note that as onyx is a naturally formed product each piece may vary slightly in colour and pattern from the picture shown.</p>

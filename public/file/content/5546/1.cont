	<span style="font-size: 12px">This unique birch Christmas cone and berry decoration has a fantastic rustic look to it and would make a beautiful Christmas accessory in any home. It would look lovely in the centre of the Christmas table, decorating fireplaces or simply placed on a windowsill. The cone shaped decoration is made from layered thick birch wood twigs with pine cones, berries, wooden stars and green fern leaves placed around them. It is then lightly finished with a white coating to give a more wintery look. The decoration measures 30cm tall and the base measures 12cm wide.</span></p>

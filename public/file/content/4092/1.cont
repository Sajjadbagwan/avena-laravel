	This amazing looking skull has so much character about it, with its cracks, hollow features and the odd missing tooth. This skull just gets better, as lying on the crown of the skull is a stone effect dragon attached with chains. The dragon looks fierce with its wings up and mouth wide open showing its teeth. The dragon&rsquo;s tail winds down the back of the skull with spikes starting from the top of the neck to the tip of the tail.&nbsp; This skull and dragon figurine is approx.10cm tall and 11cm wide.</p>

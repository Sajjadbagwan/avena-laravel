	A delightful blend of forest aromas. Resin incense is absolutely the oldest kind of incense and is allegedly in exactly the same form as used by the three wise men&nbsp;2,000 years ago. The use of tree resin as an aromatic substance can be traced back much further to over&nbsp;6,000 years ago. The smoky fragrance produced by burning the resin granules on charcoal discs is quite unique and amazingly evocative. To use place half a teaspoon of the resin incense in the well of a charcoal tablet and place in a holder or on a heat resistant surface.&nbsp; Light the side of the charcoal tablet which will then smoulder around the rim on its own and slowly heat the incense in the well of the charcoal tablet.&nbsp; The incense will then simmer away and fill the room with a beautiful aroma. Just a few grains of pure resin incense is enough to fragrance a house (or church). The resin comes packaged in a glass jar.</p>

<p>A fantastic selection in colours of our wonderful glass stars which come delivered by the kilo bag with approx 60 stars per bag. These stars are ideal for many purposes including mosaics, fish tanks, floral decorations in vases and many arts and craft uses. They are a particularly great seller in our Skipton shop and children especially love to collect them. Each star is approx 30mm in diameter.</p>

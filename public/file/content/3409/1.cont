<p>Light a Nag Champa Aastha giant incense stick to turn your garden or patio into a fragrant and enchanted haven. The unique Nag Champa scent is based around the Champa flower, also known as Plumeria. This is blended with a high concentration of sandalwood to give a smooth scent that relaxes without been overpowering but is strong enough in this thick stick for any garden. Hand rolled in India from pure extracts and fine scented oils this great Nag Champa incense creates the perfect atmosphere for blissful relaxation and indulgent entertaining. This is a single massive 50g stick and each stick is a whopping 40cm long with an unbelievable burning time of eight hours. The biggest incense stick we sell. Aastha is ideal as an outdoor incense as the sticks will stand upright in soil, grass or planters but are equally as good for use indoors where that bit extra is needed.</p>

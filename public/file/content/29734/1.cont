	This chime showcases a unique and beautiful sounding feature called octave doubling.&quot; Each note appears again one octave higher than the main scale. This expands the range of the chime while adding harmonic content and beauty to the sound.</p>
<p>
	This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance. It is hand-tuned to a universal, pentatonic (five-note) scale and acts in concert with the wind to create random patterns of wonderful sound. Harmonizes beautifully with all the other Encore Collection chimes.</p>

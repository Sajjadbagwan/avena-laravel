	This large mug is made of dolomite with a lot of attention to detail; a magically Harry Potter shaped mug resembles the cauldrons used in Potions lessons at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
<p>
	The mould has been hand sculpted to get the perfect round shape and detailed handles. This mug features &#39;Hogwarts&#39; in a scroll and the title given to the Potions professor at Hogwarts surrounded by stars. The green colour of the text and detailing nods to Potions Master Professor Severus Snape who was sorted into Slytherin during his time as a student at Hogwarts.</p>

	The back features the words &quot;Note: This is an Extremely Dangerous Potion&quot;. It&#39;s perfect for a magical brew that really will make you feel like you&#39;re in the wizarding world and is a wonderful gift for any Harry Potter fan.</p>

	Ashleigh &amp; Burwood&nbsp;products are&nbsp;top quality&nbsp;items and the A la Maison Passionfruit &amp; Guava reed diffuser is a superb example of that. For those who don&#39;t like burning incense or prefer to be more eco friendly than using plug-in room fresheners a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting &amp; stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. With normal use the liquid will last up to 4 months! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and sit back whilst the fragrances of sunshine &amp; warm balmy climes&nbsp;are absorbed through the stick and evaporated into your home. The sweet, juicy passion fruit provocatively combines with the exotic scent of delicious guava. Whatever the weather, invite the fragrance of a sun-kissed tropical paradise into your home.</p>

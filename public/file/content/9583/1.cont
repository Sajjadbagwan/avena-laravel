The name Winter in Venice comes from a young British entrepreneur&rsquo;s journey to Venice in the winter of 2005 on a soul-searching mission. She wanted to get to a place in her mind where she would be inspired emotionally and she found this in Venice where she had the inspiration to create a range of pamper gifts unlike any other. A few years on, and Winter in Venice has created a different, unusual, unique and truly gorgeous range of gifts. These gifts have a distinct difference in packaging, presentation, price and formulation that makes them perfect for every occasion. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This stunning looking sphere is made from chrysocolla howlite. It is a beautiful green/turquoise colour with a natural stone pattern throughout. Howlite is said to encourage fairness and clarity and is also believed to be good for teeth and bones. It is also the birthstone for Gemini (21st May - 20th June). This highly polished sphere is approximately 45mm and sits perfectly on our egg stands making it great for a display, it will also make a lovely gift when given in one of our pouches. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

	This adorable squirrel wind bell is made of cast metal with an antiqued rustic finish and is finished with an acorn wind catcher. The art of casting metal has been around for thousands of years. When heated to extremely high temperatures, metal will reach a molten state and can be poured into a mold. In this way, the ancients were able to create items of both enormous utility and great beauty. The same basic processes are used in foundries today. From butterflies to blue whales, the earth teems with life. Areas that sustain life are called habitats, and each habitat is part of an interconnected system that makes the richness of our life on Earth possible. Our Woodstock Habitats series celebrates the variety of nature around us. This fantastic Squirrel Wind Bell hangs at 48cm long from the hook to the wind catcher at the bottom. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Nutty Squirrel Wind Bell.</p>

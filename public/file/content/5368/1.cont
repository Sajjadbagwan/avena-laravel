	This gorgeous lip balm was inspired by evening walks along the beach; the exotic flavour blends coconut with creamy vanilla to create an intense, buttery lip treatment. Because of its size, it is perfect to carry around in handbags, purses or even in pockets. This gorgeous lip balm was made with pure essential oils, smells and tastes delicious while it hydrates the lips and leaves them luxuriously smooth which make it the perfect gift for someone who is a lover of lip care and loves to fabulous. Directions for use: for external lip use only, apply liberally and evenly over the lips as often as necessary.</p>

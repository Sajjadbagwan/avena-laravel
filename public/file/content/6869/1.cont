	This charming dream catcher features a unicorn with a glowing horn set on the background of a tree and lake that&#39;s reflecting the stars in the sky surrounded by white clouds. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams and these designs are now one of our best sellers. This dream catcher is approximately 40cm long from the hook to the bottom feather.</p>

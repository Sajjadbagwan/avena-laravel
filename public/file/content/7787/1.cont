<h2>
	What&rsquo;s in a name?</h2>
<p>
	The name Amethyst derives from the Greek word ametusthos, meaning &ldquo;not intoxicated,&rdquo; and comes from an ancient legend. Bacchus (hence the term Bacchus stone) also known as Dionysus, a wine god was angered over an insult and declared that the next person he should meet would be attacked and devoured by his tigers. Unfortunately this was a beautiful maiden named Amethyst on her way to worship. At the shrine of Diana the tigers attacked Amethyst who prayed to her Goddess for protection. Dianna saved Amethyst by transforming her into a clear crystalline statue to protect her. Dionysus immediately deeply regretted his actions and some say cried tears of wine which he poured over the crystal statue as a peace offering giving the stone its deep purple hue and thus creating Amethyst the stone.</p>

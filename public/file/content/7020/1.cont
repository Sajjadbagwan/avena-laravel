	This beautiful large tortoise is made out of resin. It is a fantastic ornament to put outside next to plant pots, a pond or just nestled between flowers, but also makes a wonderful decoration for inside the house or conservatory. It is extremely cute looking with its brown and green colours topped with a glossy finish. The little details on its skin and shell and even the twinkle in his beady eyes add to the effect the tortoise has. This tortoise measures 24cm long and 17cm wide. Why not give as a gift to someone who loves nature&#39;s little creatures?</p>

	A beautiful glass butterfly with sapphire wings on an almost invisible wire with a hook, finished with a 20mm Swarovski&reg; rainbow maker crystal.<br />
	This piece measures 15cm from the top hook to the bottom of the crystal, and comes packaged in a cardboard gift box.<br />
	Hung in a sunlit window this crystal will make the most beautiful and mesmerising dancing rainbow display, although they are so lovely they can be hung anywhere and make ideal gifts for many occasions such as Christenings, Mothers&#39; Day, house warming, birthdays, Valentine&#39;s etc.<br />

How buying this item supports the WWF - Our supplier gives a percentage from each sale to the WWF, which is covered in the trade price we pay them. The supplier then absorbs the royalties paid to WWF so we can still offer these beautiful hand-made and fair trade items to you at a good price. The more we sell the more we order and the more will then get donated. It is a great privilege for Avena to support such a well-respected and world-renowned conservation and environmental charity as the WWF and to help disadvantaged producers from across the developing world in order to assist them to trade out of poverty. &copy; Please do not copy text.

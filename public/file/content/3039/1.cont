<p>The practice of Buddhism began 2,500 years ago. Only within the past century have Western cultures reached out to embrace Buddhist wisdom, whose essence is to awaken and to serve. Blocking ones mortal path to awakened or enlightened service are egotism, greed and selfishness, each of which leads to endless and needless suffering. The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism are said to move beyond earthly limitations and thereby reach Nirvana, a state of mind that is completely and permanently free of suffering. This great looking oil burner features three famous praying Buddha sculptures, each positioned to balance the glass burning dish above a centre well holding the tea light. It is finished in a grey/brown stone effect with great detail and standing 15cm high is a wonderful oil burner. Individually well packed in a sturdy box would make a lovely gift idea.</p>

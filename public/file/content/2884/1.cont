	A set of two comical garden pixies. One is sat on a tree stump and the other on a large snails shell. Both are wearing shorts and large comical shoes with coloured hats. Made from resin with great detail and colour both pixies come packed together in a decorative gift box and are 100mm tall. They make a wonderful and amusing addition to any house but are just as happy outdoors and would look great nestled between flowers in the garden, in a rockery, stood in plant pots or in greenhouse/potting shed etc. Now on offer at &pound;5.99 for the pair.</p>

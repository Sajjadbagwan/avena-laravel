	This stunning traditional black dream catcher is made up of five hoops and decorated with brown string, black feathers, silver patterned beads and a piece of howlite in each loop. This fantastic dream catcher would make the perfect addition to any household. This five hoop large dream catcher measures approximately 60cm from the hanger on the top to the bottom feather. The biggest hoop is 15cm, the medium hoops are 8cm and the smallest hoop is 5.5cm in diameter. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Black Triple Dream Catcher Large.</p>

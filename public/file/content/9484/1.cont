	A fantastic selection of six fragrance oils that are perfect for those cosy winter nights and days with their warm and festive aromas. These lovely oils are stored in our dark wood design wooden oil box which is an essential tool when keeping or transporting your oils because it protects them from light when not in use and prolongs their freshness. Each winter fragrance oil gift box contains a 10ml bottle each of Christmas mix, cinnamon, cranberry, pine, orange and frankincense and myrrh plus the vintage looking wooden storage box. If purchased separately this set would cost &pound;24.93 - our winter oils offer is all these oils and the box for only &pound;19.99!</p>

	The description and image for each gift set is accurate when added to our website but should any item be out of stock we may replace this with a similar item and the boxes can alternate between the two images as these are proving hard to get hold of. This would mean there&#39;s no delay for delivery but we would only do this with an item of the same or higher value. &copy; Please do not copy text.

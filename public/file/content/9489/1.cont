	After a cold day there&rsquo;s nothing better than popping your chilly feet into a warmed up pair of soft and fluffy slippers. These fantastic slippers are manufactured in a luxurious high quality fabric that is wonderfully soft to the touch. They are filled with a new improved organic filling material with a hint of French Lavender. To heat, simply place in a microwave for two minutes to then slowly release soothing heat and a relaxing aroma whilst keeping your toes toasty. Furry slippers are manufactured from the very highest quality materials and make a fantastic gift as they come in one free size (approximately 3-7). &copy; Please do not copy text.

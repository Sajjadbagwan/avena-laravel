	This luxurious Pamper Pink Gift Box contains a novel rose scented soap sponge which gives a great way to lather up in the bath or shower; a delicate rose scented sachet together with a gorgeous rose votive candle and rose scented incense cones to fragrance your home; a gentle and moisturising rose soap along with two of our very popular bath treats to fizz away in the bath. All of these gorgeous products are lovingly hand packed into a plain card box with a sticker placed on the front which can be used to put to whom the gift set is for, or can be a place for a lovely message to the recipient. The cost of these products if purchased individually would be &pound;22.48 and as well as all the luxury contents, this Avena gift set also comes with a fantastic money off voucher for the recipient saving them 25% off their next online order, making the gift set complete and even better value! The description and image for each gift set is accurate when added to our website but should any item be out of stock we may replace this with a similar item so as not to delay delivery but we would only do this with an item of the same or higher value.</p>

	This fascinating dream catcher shows a beautiful artwork by Lisa Parker named &lsquo;Loyal Companions&rsquo; featuring a stunning orange-eyed wolf couple resting upon one another with a tree bark background. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams, this dream catcher is approx. 80cm long from the hook to the bottom feather and the actual picture has a diameter of approximately 32cm.

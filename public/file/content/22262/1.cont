	We proud to give you this alternative skull, available as part of our skull high-value collection. Covered in arcane and mysterious mechanisms, this skull has been modified almost beyond recognition. The eye sockets have been filled with interlocking gears of iron and brass, and a sturdy iron ring hangs from a bolt through the nose hole. Wires and pipes snake in and out, connecting to the machinery elsewhere on the skull. The whole ensemble is topped with a belt of bullets forming a Mohawk down the centre of the skull. Cast in the finest resin before being carefully hand-painted, this skull is an essential part of any Gothic, Fantasy or Steampunk collection. It&rsquo;s 23cm tall and has great design, colours and the quality you would expect from Nemesis Now.</p>

	Hematite is a wonderful gunmetal grey colour and said to protect and strengthen determination and self-awareness whilst enhancing personal magnetism, will and courage. It is also believed to be beneficial for blood flow, nerves and easing stress. Hematite is the birthstone for Aries (21st March - 20th April) and the symbol of willpower. This gorgeous agogo pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

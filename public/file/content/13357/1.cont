	These highly polished &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade tumblestones are crafted from natural amethyst stone and come packaged in a large, black drawstring pouch, making it the perfect gift idea for any occasion. The whole lot can be given as a gift set or as they are individual pieces, they can be split up and given out as individual gifts while keeping some for yourself. Alternatively they can all be kept for your own entertainment and we won&rsquo;t tell anyone. We will also include a special 25% off voucher which you can use on your next order or pass on if they are a gift. Amethyst is said to aid soothing, healing and cleansing, it is still one of the most popular stones there are even though it is slightly more expensive than some others. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. The average size for each tumblestone is approximately 2cm long. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Amethyst Gift Pouch of Ten Polished Tumblestones.&nbsp;</p>

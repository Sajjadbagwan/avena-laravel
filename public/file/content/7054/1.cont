	This unusual 3D bookmark is designed by the popular artist Lisa Parker, illustrating dark, gothic and black colours with a beautiful fairy riding a black rearing unicorn. This charming fairy is wearing a long blue dress and holding a long staff in her hand with the moon shining in the night sky. This fantastic 3D effect bookmark is made with layers of images topped with a clear lens coating that create the impression of depth in the picture. Bookmarks were used throughout the medieval period,&nbsp;consisting usually of a small parchment strip attached to the edge of&nbsp;folio. As the first printed books were quite rare and valuable, it was determined early on that something was needed to mark one&#39;s place in a book without causing its pages any harm. Some of the earliest bookmarks were used at the end of the sixteenth century, and&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth I of England&nbsp;was one of the first to own one. This Lisa Parker bookmark is 15cm long and 5cm wide and comes with black tassels.</p>

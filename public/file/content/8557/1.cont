	This eye-catching dream catcher is created from a design by Lisa Parker. The moon gazing hare is sitting in a field of blue flowers looking at the sky, while the full moon is shining between the stars, illuminating the whole scene. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. They are very popular with children suffering from bad dreams. The dream catcher is approximately 50cm long from the hook to the bottom of the feathers and the actual picture has a diameter of approximately 10cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	A wonderful gift set of SIX natural base oils from Avena. A varied mix from the cheaper widely used Grapeseed to the more expensive, luxurious Argan and beautiful scented Plum. Buying six together not only gives you a natural oil for nearly everything you could possibly need one for but it also works out cheaper than buying them individually. At the time of listing this gift set these oils would cost over &pound;50 if purchased separately so that&rsquo;s a great saving of over &pound;10 already! They make a nice gift set which can be given away as a whole package or can be split up and given out as individual gifts while keeping some for yourself. Alternatively they could all be kept for your own indulgence and we won&#39;t tell anyone! We will also include a special 25% off voucher which you can use on your next order or pass on if they are a gift. The natural Avena oils included are: Comfrey base infused oil 100ml, Arnica base infused oil 100ml, Grapeseed oil 100ml, Argan organic oil 100ml, Vitamin-E infused oil 100ml and Plum oil 100ml with its beautiful and unique aroma. All the oils can be used on their own, mixed with other carrier oils and/or blended with essential oils to make your own aromatherapy treatments, massage oils, bath oils etc. making this the ideal kit for anyone from an aromatherapy expert to a novice wanting to try a range of blends or oils. All the oils selected for this gift set are the better sellers from the base oil range and widely used in aromatherapy, descriptions and uses for each can be found on the individual listings within our website. All are beautiful, fresh, natural, top quality oils are paraben and SLS free, they don&rsquo;t contain alcohol or any &#39;nasties&#39; and even the bottles and lids are recyclable. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This stunning, high quality, handcrafted fragrance lamp is a luxurious and fashionable way to diffuse and fragrance any area within the house. Designed and made with a delicate glass mosaic finish, this fragrance lamp is covered in deep red and golden colours, with a gold cap and a detailed patterned brass top. This specific design utilises the century old catalytic combustion technique, filtering air-borne molecules that cause unwanted odours within the home and replacing them with the gentle fragrance that is contained within, which spreads evenly and quickly around the area. This lamp comes in a lovely presentation black gift box with gold calligraphy and patterns on the front.&nbsp; This lamp would make a beautiful gift for someone special. The lamp itself is approx. 12cm tall, and the box is approx. 15cm long and 10cm wide. To use the lamp simply place the lamp oil fragrance of choice in the lamp. Insert the wick into the fragrance with the stone placed on top and leave to soak for around 20-30 minutes. Place the lamp on a heat resistant surface and light the stone. (Be aware that the flame may become quite high and the stone will get hot.) Leave the flame lit for around 2-3 minutes without any caps over it, then simply blow the flame out. Then place the decorative cap supplied over the stone as the lamp gets to work evaporating the delicious aroma. To stop it, simply take the decorative cap off (be careful as it may be hot!!) and place the snuffer cap over the stone which will stop the fragrance from evaporating.</p>

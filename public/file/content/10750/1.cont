	Our Rugby Player&rsquo;s 2-in-1 Massage and Bath Oil is a naturally deep, nourishing and restoring oil made for either direct massage or to be used as a muscle ease bath oil. Our massage and bath oils not only look sleek and stylish with a hint of humour in the personalised labels but a great deal of thought and care have gone into the blending of each one. Essential oils of rosemary, lavender and thyme to help naturally restore overexerted muscles and promote increased blood circulation releasing tension and refreshing body tissues are blended in a mix of cosmetic grade sweet almond and sunflower oils plus each bottle has a splash of vitamin E to finish. They are then hand poured into a large stylish 250ml dark blue bottle and topped off with a black cap, both of which are recyclable, meaning that they are good for your body and the packaging is good for the environment. For massage apply small amounts of oil using the fingertips and massaging into muscles in long, firm strokes before and after sport or exercise. For use in the bath pour the desired amount (we recommend about 10ml) into the bath under running warm water, relax and soak for at least 15 minutes. When used in warm water, skin pores are opened which allows the oils to be rapidly absorbed and get to work immediately. These blends may not be the cheapest oils on the market but we have carefully selected everything to do with them from the ingredients to the packing and novelty label before blending and bottling up each one individually meaning we can assure you that there&rsquo;s a little bit of Avena-love in every bottle and with the novelty labels they do make a lovely, very thoughtful and still affordable gift, especially with the mix and match offer of any 3 for &pound;19.99 (which can be mixed with other products in the offer) and the bigger size of 250ml. &copy; Please do not copy text.

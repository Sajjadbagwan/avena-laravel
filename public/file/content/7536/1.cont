	This fantastic, rustic looking coaster set comprises four different coasters that are made of quality resin with a paraffin finish at the bottom of them; all very similar looking in the way they are coloured light brown and decorated with black and red letters of different texts. This fun set of coasters features phrases associated with cooking and eating including &ldquo;If no one sees you eat it&hellip; it has no calories&rdquo;, &ldquo;Help keep this kitchen clean &ndash; eat out&rdquo;, &ldquo;A messy kitchen is a happy kitchen and this kitchen is delirious&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stressed spelled backwards is Desserts&rdquo;. These quirky coasters would make a brilliant addition to your kitchen accessories and would look great on the coffee table, by the fireplace etc. and would make the perfect gift idea for a not so serious cook. Each coaster measures 9.5cm x 9.5cm.</p>

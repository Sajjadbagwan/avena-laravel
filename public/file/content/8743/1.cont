	Hematite is said to enhance personal magnetism, will and courage. It is also said to be beneficial for blood flow, stress and the nerves. Thumb stones are also known as worry stones and are made of smooth, polished gemstones in the shape of an oval with a thumb-sized indentation. They are used by holding the stone between the index finger and thumb, gently moving one&#39;s thumb back and forth across the stone. These worry stones are ideal to use for crystal healing and are useful tools in meditation. This hematite thumb stone measures 4cm x 3cm wide. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust, but we can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as it comes in and change the photo as each one sells, so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we will be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Hematite Thumb Stone.</p>

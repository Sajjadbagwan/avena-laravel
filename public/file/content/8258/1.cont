	This delightful set of cherub letters spelling out the word &lsquo;MUM&rsquo; would be a perfect gift for any occasion especially for Mother&rsquo;s Day, but most of all as a thank you to your Mum for all the support and loving care. It is a wonderful and decorative piece for any home and would make the perfect addition to any room including living room, bedroom or hallway placed on a shelf, windowsill or mantelpiece. Each letter has a cherub in a different position to the others and they are supported on a base so they are an all-in-one sturdy piece of word block. Cherubs are winged angelic beings and described in biblical tradition as attending on God. They were represented in ancient Middle Eastern art as a lion or bull with eagles&rsquo; wings and a human face. Cherubs are regarded in traditional Christian angelology as an angel of the second highest order of the celestial hierarchy. The letters and the stand are made from resin and are white in colour. Each letter is approximately 4cm tall and 3.5cm wide and the base is approximately 13.5 long and 0.5cm wide.</p>

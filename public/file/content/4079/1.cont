	This beautiful mini square oil burner, with its attached bowl top is delightful with its 3D elephant pattern around the base. The colour of the oil burner is a dark green which slightly drifts into black towards the bottom, creating a lovely colour effect. This oil burner would complement any room it is to be put in and also takes up little room. It would also be a fantastic gift to give to someone with a few of our lovely fragrance oils. To use, simply place a tea light into the base and light carefully. Fill the oil well up to 2/3 full with water and then add a few drops of your favourite oil. The oil burner stands approx. 8cm tall.</p>

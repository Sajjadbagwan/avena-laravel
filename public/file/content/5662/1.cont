	Drop your Snowman bath blaster into a warm bath and watch him fizz away, releasing cocoa butters and pure essential oils, with a warming, satisfying cinnamon fragrance for cold winter nights. You can use your bath blaster up to four times by dropping it in the bath and allowing a portion of it to melt. Your bath blaster will fizz very softly releasing moisturising cocoa butter and essential oils. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your&nbsp;bath blaster&nbsp;to dissolve and remove it from the bath to save the rest for later. Wash any petals away after use to prevent accidental staining of the bath.&nbsp;This bath&nbsp;blaster is also suitable for vegans.

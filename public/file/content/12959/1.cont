Purple agate represents royalty, spirituality and enlightenment. Named by the Greek naturalist Theophrastus between the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, agates have long fascinated humans. They form over long periods of time in nodules left in volcanic rock and are often used as grounding stones, bringing balance to our emotional, physical and intellectual state and promoting stability and strength. Sliced thinly to reveal its translucent beauty, each piece of agate is unique. May the music of the chimes, combined with this ancient earth energy, bring harmony and balance to your life. A great quality chime made from aluminium, this chime is a good size measuring approximately 45cm in total and is carefully packed in its own box making a lovely gift. The agate slice is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. &copy; Please do not copy text.

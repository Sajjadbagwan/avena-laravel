	This lovely soap will blast the dark clouds away with the combination of Mother Nature&#39;s chamomile and lavender essential oils. Enjoy a fruity lather which will leave your skin deliciously scented and soft to the touch! This lovely Red Berry Blast has juicy opening notes of blackcurrant, and then the fruity heart blends summer strawberries and raspberries with the subtle scent of blueberries. The creamy caramel and vanilla complement the natural sweetness of the delicious fruits for a warm finish. This wonderful soap can be used like any normal bar of soap but is much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with or alternatively, rub the bar onto a sponge. This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being hand made the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured.</p>

	Grott the gargoyle is sat crossed legged, reading on a pile of three larger books. The quality on this piece is excellent from the symbols and lettering on the pages he is reading to the colours and detail throughout. He would make a fantastic ornamental piece on his own but this is also a trinket box. Grott and the top book he is sitting on lift up to reveal a good sized hidden compartment in the below books, ideal for jewellery, loose change or anything secretive you would like him to guard. The piece is solid (apart from the compartment) and quite heavy weighing over 800g. It is 13cm tall and 12cm long.&nbsp; Packed in a block of polystyrene for safe transit and then in a blue and black gloss printed box he would make a wonderful gift.</p>

	This lovely yet spooky wooden plaque is ideal for Halloween decoration as it shows two smiling pumpkins, a leafless tree and a witch flying on a broom in the light of the full moon with the words &lsquo;Forget the ghosts - beware of me!&rsquo;. Complete with a wire hanger it can be hung anywhere around the house but this one is especially popular as a door welcome sign or hung facing out of a window as the perfect way to welcome party guests or kids on their trick or treat rounds. This Halloween wooden hanger measures 12cm tall and 12cm wide.</p>

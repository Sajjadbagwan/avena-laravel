	This pack of three hand painted fruit shaped soaps looks amazing and smells divine. If you can&rsquo;t decide which single soap is your favourite to buy for yourself or to give as a gift, this pack is definitely the answer. It contains three of the most popular fruits in one gift box, which are orange, apple and lemon. What more could you ask for as you even make a saving of &pound;5 when you buy the pack of three instead of three single soaps! These soaps are often used purely for decoration as they look so fabulous and can simply be placed in rooms to release their fragrance and look pretty. As these soaps come presented in a lovely box they would also be great to give as a gift. As the soap is hand painted with harmless food colouring, before the first use of the soap rinse it under warm water for 2-3 minutes, gently rubbing off the colouring. Then your pure natural soap is ready to use. If they are just being used purely for their decorative effect, if kept away from humidity your soaps will continue to look beautiful for many years.</p>

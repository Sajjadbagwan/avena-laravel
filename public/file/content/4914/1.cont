	This set of elegant cherub letters spelling out the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; is a wonderful decorative piece for any home. Each letter is separate and free standing, meaning you can position them any way you like. They would look lovely on a shelf displayed close together or apart. Each of the letters has a cherub positioned in a different way to the others. The letters are made from resin and are white in colour. Cherubs are winged angelic beings and are described in biblical tradition as attending on God. They are represented in ancient Middle Eastern art as a lion or bull with eagles&rsquo; wings and a human face. Cherubs are regarded in traditional Christian angelology as an angel of the second highest order of the celestial hierarchy. Each letter is approximately 6cm tall and 6cm wide and would make a lovely addition to any room. They would be the perfect gift for any occasion, or for someone special as an anniversary gift or birthday present etc.&nbsp;</p>

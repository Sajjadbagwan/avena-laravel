	A super little box for burning incense cones and mini sticks. The hinged lid opens to reveal the brass burning well to sit your smoking incense cones in. You can then close the lid and place the box in any room. The smoke and fragrance then escapes through the fretwork pattern within the lid. There are also two small holes to stand incense sticks upright. A great idea and a very popular line. The incense box dimensions are 6cm tall, 5.5cm wide and 8cm long.</p>

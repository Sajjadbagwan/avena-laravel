	Undertaken in 1938 and completed in 1943, this deck assimilates Crowley&rsquo;s inspired ideas on restructuring the traditional pictorial symbolism of the ancient wisdom of tarot. Lady Frieda Harris&rsquo; colour-drenched Art Deco interpretations clarify Crowley&rsquo;s intricate esoteric theories. Crowley originally intended the Thoth deck to be a six-month project aimed at updating the traditional pictorial symbolism of the tarot. However, the project was to span five years, between 1938 and 1943, as its scope grew ever wider. Crowley and Harris were meticulous in their work, and Harris painted some of the cards as many as eight times. This fascinating tarot deck includes 78 cards and a 48-page instruction booklet written by James Wasserman. The instruction booklet includes two essays by Lady Frieda Harris.<br />

	This meditating monk is sitting on an altar with a calm smile and his hands held together creating a very peaceful image in his surroundings. He would make a great decoration placed anywhere in the home including hallways, living room and bedroom or even in the kitchen, but would also look fantastic in any conservatory, patio and garden. This wonderful monk would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of these Chinese ornaments and would make a lovely addition to an existing monk or Buddha collection. This sitting monk measures 20cm tall, 13x13cm wide at the base and is quite heavy for its size, weighing nearly 1.5kg. This lovely indoor and outdoor ornament is packaged in a plain card box. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Meditating Monk.</p>

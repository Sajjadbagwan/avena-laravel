	This fascinating dream catcher shows a design by the popular artist, Lisa Parker, illustrating a picture of a magnificent stag peeking through the bushes whilst the ascending moon illuminates the night sky. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams, this dream catcher is approximately 40cm long from the hook to the bottom feather and the actual picture has a diameter of 11cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	The image on this unusual 3D bookmark is designed by the popular artist Lisa Parker, and shows a raven holding a pentagram pendant whilst the moon shines through the window. This fantastic 3D effect bookmark is made with layers of images topped with a clear lens coating that create the impression of depth in the picture. Please note that the reason the image is blurry is due to the item being 3D and hard to photograph. The actual image on the item is clear and great quality. Bookmarks were used throughout the medieval period, consisting usually of a small parchment strip attached to the edge of folio. As the first printed books were quite rare and valuable, it was determined early on that something was needed to mark one&#39;s place in a book without causing its pages any harm. Some of the earliest bookmarks were used at the end of the sixteenth century, and Queen Elizabeth I of England was one of the first to own one. This Lisa Parker bookmark is 15cm long and 5cm wide and comes with black tassels. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description Raven with Pendant 3D Bookmark by Lisa Parker.</p>

	Hematite is a wonderful gunmetal grey colour and is said to protect and strengthen determination and self-awareness whilst enhancing personal magnetism, will and courage. It is also believed to be beneficial for blood flow, nerves and easing stress. Hematite is the birthstone for Aries (21st March - 20th April) and the symbol of willpower. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our bracelets are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary from stone to stone and differ slightly from the image shown giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

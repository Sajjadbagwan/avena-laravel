	This fantastic looking wind spiral is completed with a red glass ball inset and hook making it the perfect accessory for any garden, patio or conservatory. This mesmerising spiral tail comes fully assembled so all you have to do is finding the perfect spot for it and leave the rest to the wind! The wind spiral is made from quality stainless steel that will not rust or tarnish whilst outside. To keep it maintained it may just require an occasional light wash with rust proof window or stainless steel cleanser. This marvellous spiral tail would also make the perfect complement to any wind spinner by attaching it to the bottom of the spinner and would make a wonderful addition to any home. As this spiral twists in the wind, when in motion, the red ball appears to travel up and down the tail creating a hypnotising illusion. The spiral measures approximately 30cm long and unless it is attached to a wind spinner it does require a strong wind to turn fully but alternatively you could use a battery powered motor. &copy; Please do not copy text.

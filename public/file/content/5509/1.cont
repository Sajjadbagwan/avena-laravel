	<span style="font-size: 12px">This is Daffy the gargoyle. He has been formed in a detailed grotesque design finished with black and grey colours. This fantastic creature is sitting down with his knee pulled up to his body and with his feet placed over each other. He has his arm wrapped around his legs as he pulls his mouth to&nbsp;the&nbsp;side with his thin finger. Daffy is looking up with his orange eyes as someone has just made a joke&nbsp;about him and he&#39;s&nbsp;trying to say he does not care what anybody thinks. This gargoyle has his ears pulled down as he is angry and he has wings on his back with spikes running down between them. Daffy makes a fantastic ornament in a garden next to a plant pot as well as put in the house or conservatory by the fireplace or towards a collection. He is made of solid resin and is packed in polystyrene for safe transit, and put into his own box. This ornament is approximately 10cm tall and 8cm wide and would make the perfect gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures. &nbsp;</span></p>

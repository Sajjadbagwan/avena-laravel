	Orange calcite is a lesser known stone but still a very popular one, sometimes just for the fantastic colour alone but it also has soft, tranquil, happy and healthy properties as well as being believed to aid the acquisition of wisdom. This orange calcite heart is approximately 4cm x 4cm in size. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

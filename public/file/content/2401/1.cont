	Lumpy the gargoyle is very comical and is crouching on his back legs holding a book with a unique expression to say the least! He is quite an ugly thing even by gargoyle standards with pointy eyebrows, three horns on his head and a very toothy smile but still needs a home and we hope someone takes pity on him! Lumpy is a solid piece and quite heavy for his size, the colour and detail is top quality as with all the Studio Collection. He is packed in a polystyrene cube for safe transit and then in a blue and black printed gift box. He is 11.5cm tall and 9.6cm from front to back.</p>

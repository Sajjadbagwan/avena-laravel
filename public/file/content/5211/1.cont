	<span style="font-size: 12px">These wonderfully unique stones are already proving to&nbsp;be a big hit in our shop. Made for the garden they can withstand the&nbsp;elements and are frost resistant but are just as happy indoors looking&nbsp;great on any shelf, desk, fireplace or getting interesting looks if&nbsp;placed on a windowsill sticking its tongue out at passers by or neighbours. They can also be used as a door stop, paperweight&nbsp;etc. and make a great comical gift. They are made from quality resin and have a granite type finish to them; they are&nbsp;solid, sturdy and quite heavy. Set in the centre of the stone is a protruding and very realistic big pink tongue. The tongue then has a metal zip attached around it. Why?&nbsp;We have no idea but love them or hate them they are selling fast! They are&nbsp;solid, durable and great quality making a fantastic and different gift&nbsp;idea and they now come in a fab gift box. The tongue stone come in two different sizes, the larger one stands at 18cm tall and 17cm wide whilst the smaller size (pictured) stands at 12cm tall and 11cm wide.</span></p>

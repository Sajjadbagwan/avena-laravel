	Nag Champa musk natural soap is delicately infused with aromatic musk and the classic, earthy fragrance of the champa flower which is associated with Nag Champa incense giving your skin a healthy balance and bringing freshness and calmness to mind and body. The blend of aromatherapy oils creates a unique aroma and makes this&nbsp;a more unisex bar than some of the more floral soaps. Musk soap contains palm oil which is rich in vitamins A and&nbsp;E and fatty acids, coconut oil which acts as a protective antioxidant and keeps the skin soft and smooth with glycerine which draws moisture from the air and holds it to the skin. It is cruelty free and it contains no animal fat, products or harsh chemicals. Its beautiful rich lather is a natural deodorant and wonderful skin softener which is also pH balanced and allergy tested. This is an original Nag Champa product from Satya Saibaba and is of super quality (beware of imitations).</p>

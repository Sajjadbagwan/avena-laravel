	Orange calcite is a lesser known stone but still a very popular one, sometimes just for the fantastic colour alone but it also has soft, tranquil, happy and healthy properties as well as being believed to aid the acquisition of wisdom. Crystals or healing gemstones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your wellbeing. Does it work? Wear one, carry one with you, have them in your house or take one to bed to find out. All our stones are of a&nbsp;fantastic quality, rich in colour, smooth and polished. The average stone is 20-30mm but this does vary slightly as each is a unique natural shape and they make a fantastic gift idea in our mini drawstring pouches.</p>

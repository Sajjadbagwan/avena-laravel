	Throughout our lives we face many trials and challenges. A means of helping us cope with these difficult times and seek strength and guidance, is to communicate with our angels.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	We all have angels that watch over us, it is just a case of getting in touch with them and being open to the guidance we are offered.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Many people find stones, ornaments and other sentimental objects enable them to connect with their angels. Being in a calm, quiet, safe place is also important. Angels are drawn to calm, open and organised spaces, so bear this in mind. It will also help you relax and open up to receive any messages your angels are trying to send to you. Sometimes these messages can be in the form of a very soft, faint feeling - often, people say they &quot;just knew&quot;. To be able to detect this, you will need to be relaxed and in a calm, quiet space. First thing in the morning, or just before you fall asleep are common times for people to have some interaction with their angels. Keeping your stones or ornaments next to your bed can assist this.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	It is important for you to be receptive to messages. Staying away from alcohol and other stimulants can help us maintain a clear channel for our angels. A healthy diet will also encourage calmness and well being. It will also keep your angels happy and confident that you are looking after yourself!&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Patience is a virtue every angel is inherently instilled with and is something you will need. Even if you aren&#39;t always receiving the answers you seek, be patient and keep trying. It may be your angel is not communicating in the way you&#39;re expecting, or you need to hear it a few more times. Don&#39;t be scared to keep asking - your angel won&#39;t mind at all. Compare experiences with friends and perhaps ask to try their ornaments or stones. If you or friends have Oracle Cards for Guidance or Healing, try these to establish contact. It may be that this is the method for you and your angels. Doreen Virtue cards are very popular.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Most importantly, never forget your angels are watching over you, even if we can&#39;t always hear or feel them.</div>

	A fantastic fair trade solid wood Buddha.&nbsp; This is a fabulous ornate wooden Buddha who has the most appeasing laughing face and who is sat in the traditional crossed leg pose of the Buddha.&nbsp; Buddha is the ultimate symbol of happiness, wealth and good fortune. Buddha&#39;&#39;s belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity and by stroking it, it is believed to bring much good luck. The laughing Buddha must always be invited into his new home, resulting in positive Chi bringing great happiness. Always place your Buddha in a position of honour and never on the floor. He can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office etc. but avoid bathrooms and toilets. This fair trade&nbsp;Buddha is great quality, solid and&nbsp;is 15cm tall x 16cm wide.</p>

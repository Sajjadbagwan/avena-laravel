This remarkable train has been expertly made by welding everyday metal objects together such as nails, screws, washers, bolts, lengths of metal, small pieces of sheet metal and more. The whole thing has then been electroplated which is an electrochemical process that deposits a thin layer of metal onto a metal base to create a glossy metallic finish and looks great! (This item is not recommended for young children due to small parts and some sharp edges.) This locomotive complete with tracks and driver has great detail and looks absolutely stunning. We have this line on sale in our shop and get comments from passing customers daily about how good it looks! Each locomotive comes packaged in its own box and makes a fantastic gift but please be aware this great line will sell out fast so buy now to save disappointment. Height 13cms, Length 35cms. Free postage to any UK. address.

	This wonderful soap slice is created like the classic British dessert of ripe strawberries accompanied with light and fluffy whipped cream blended together with pure clary sage and bergamot essential oil for a mouth-watering treat. This wonderful soap can be used like any normal bar of soap but is much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with or alternatively, rub the bar onto a sponge. This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being hand made the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured. &copy; Please do not copy text.

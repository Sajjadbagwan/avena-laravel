<p>Standing cow figure made from fine quality porcelain and finished in a two tone glaze and texture. The glaze on the main part of the figure is a highly polished oily cream colour with patches of green and tan. While the head is glazed in a satin finish and coloured in a natural grey hue to contrast colour and texture with the rest of the figure. A great looking ornament and super gift idea. Each cow is carefully packed in its own box. Dimensions: Small Cow- Length 17cms, Height 14cms.</p>

	This spooky Frankenstein flip flap is full of stitches and is wearing a black outfit, all made of plastic. On the front of the base there is a solar panel which powers the rocking motion. Frankenstein&rsquo;s hips are swaying from side to side and his arms are moving up and down in the same rhythm. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light make the rocking movement, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not toys, and are not suitable for children under three years old due to small parts. Each Frankenstein flip flap comes in a clear plastic box and is 10cm tall and would make the perfect Halloween decoration. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	These wonderful &#39;Harmony Balls&#39;, once placed in the hand and manipulated by the fingers, help relieve stress and muscle tension. They stimulate the acupressure points in the hand, fingers and wrist as the muscles expand and contract rhythmically. Rolled in the hand they produce a soothing sound of chimes. Lightweight green balls with copper outlined Yin Yang symbols come in an elegant wooden gift box.</p>

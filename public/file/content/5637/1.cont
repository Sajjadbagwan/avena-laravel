	This ceramic spell potion bottle is a fantastic idea and would make a great accessory in any kitchen as it is a beautiful ornamental piece. The bottle comes in a two tone black and grey gloss colour with a light grey label design on the front explaining what it is. It has a cork stopper with a ceramic ball top, so that it is easier to take off the bottle .The bottle measures 25cm tall and 7cm in diameter. The neck of the bottle is narrower at 3cm in diameter. This potion bottle would make a great gift. For ornamental use only.</p>

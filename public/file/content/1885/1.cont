	This soap is designed for those who get really mucky, and particularly anyone who is exposed to micro-organisms, such as farmers and vets. A tough exfoliator (ground walnut shell) together with the renowned disinfectant properties of carbolic helps ensure that hands are as clean as they look. This fine body bar is rich in shea butter and is made using only the finest ingredients in a process that has remained unchanged for over a hundred years. All Christina May soaps are finely crafted and fragranced in the heart of the English countryside, making them an ideal gift or a fantastic addition in a gift hamper. This gentle and moisturising luxury soap bar will go a long way so why not try three at a time for an amazing value? Handy tip: storing these lovely body bars in your drawer with clothes, towels, bedding etc. will leave the material with a long lasting, delicious and fresh scent! &copy; Please do not copy text.

	<span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222; font-size: 9pt">A fantastic gift box containing 1 x Strawberries &amp; Dreams Bath Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e 160g, 1 x Lazy Lavender Bath Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e 160g and 1 x Milk &amp; Honey Bath Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e 160g. The fantastic thing about our bath br&ucirc;l&eacute;es is that you can use each one up to four times by simply dropping into the bath and allowing a portion of it to melt. Your bath br&ucirc;l&eacute;e will fizz very softly releasing moisturising cocoa butter and softening the water. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your br&ucirc;l&eacute;e&nbsp;to dissolve and remove it from the bath to save the rest for later. These three br&ucirc;l&eacute;es are packed in a wonderful gift box, each is in a cup cake type holder and surrounded by shredded &lsquo;straw-like&rsquo; packing and finished off with a gift bow, they also smell divine even through the packaging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	This magical deck of tarot cards was created by the artist Raffaele De Angelis who illustrates magic, lights and shadows of the fairy realm by showing us that throughout the world, we find places that express divine magic with each arcana featuring a mystical location that expresses the energy of the card. The Wailing Wall reverberates in the 9 of Swords. The Magician&#39;s power is showcased in Stonehenge. This fantastic deck of tarot cards comes with divinatory instructions and features 78 cards &ndash; 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana cards -&nbsp;in the size of 64mm x 122mm.</p>

	This beautifully decorated 3D key ring is illustrated with cold, mostly purple and blue colours and features a mystical fairy with purple roses in her hair and a pentagram on her forehead. She is also wearing a crystal necklace and a green dress which is decorated with a green dragon. The fairy&rsquo;s hand is reaching out forward controlling a floating crystal ball and she is surrounded by butterflies and roses. This double sided key ring has the high quality artwork reproduction on both sides, with a quality metal chain and frame and would make the perfect gift idea for someone who loves mystical creatures and magic. The key ring hangs at approximately 11cm.</p>

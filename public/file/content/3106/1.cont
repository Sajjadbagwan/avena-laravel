	A large dream catcher featuring a native american, wolves and an owl. This is a good size dream catcher of 34cm in diameter. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams or important messages through. Since the beginning of time, the Native Americans have been associating their lives with that of animals in the wildlife kingdom. For years, the wolf has been seen as an aggressor, when in reality they are very loving and social creatures. The Native American tribes recognized this and they have incorporated the wolf into many of their myths &amp; legends. A stunning large traditional style dream catcher adorned with beads and feathers.</p>

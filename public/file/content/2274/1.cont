	Crucifix necklace in a shiny near-black hematite that looks great and at 42cm is suitable for male or female. The most magical and mystical of all gemstones, this dark, gothic and fascinating stone is cold to the touch even in the heat of summer and worn as a bracelet can cool the blood. Interestingly the Greek word haima, which means blood, is the root of hematite&#39;s name and when hematite is cut thinly dark red streaks show up in the slices. Hematite has probably been used since the earliest days of human civilisation. For example, the ancient Egyptians used hematite in the creation of their magical amulets. Some of these amulets were treatments for madness and inflammation. Hematite relates to Mars, the Roman God of War; the Romans glorified Mars more than the Greeks did, who loathed him and knew him as Ares. Warriors in Roman times used hematite as protection during battle. So strong was their belief in the power of hematite to protect them that they thought it could even make them invincible! Spooky but true: Nasa recently discovered large deposits of hematite on Mars!</p>

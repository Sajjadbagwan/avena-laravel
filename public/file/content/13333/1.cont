	Mookaite jasper comes in a range of fascinating, earthy colours and is said to embody a beneficial energy to slow aging. It is also said to assist healing. This highly polished sphere is 45mm in diameter and sits perfectly on our egg stands so it can be displayed to show off its colours, it would also make a lovely gift when given in one of our pouches. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description<br />

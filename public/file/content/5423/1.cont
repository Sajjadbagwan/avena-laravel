	This beautiful polished sphere is made from poppy jasper. Jasper is said to be very useful for controlling the emotions and is a great stone for soothing the nerves, although this poppy jasper mainly sells due to the fantastic colour. As poppy jasper is slightly patterned each sphere looks different meaning that you get a unique piece. The sphere measures approximately 45mm and sits perfectly on our egg stands if wanted for a display, it would also make a lovely gift when given in one of our pouches. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

	We all have those days where everything seems to be against us. Our Feel Good oil is carefully blended with pure uplifting essential oils to help put the spring back into your step on those dreary days.</p>
<p>
	Feel Good oil contains a base of cosmetic grade sweet almond and sunflower oils hand blended with pure essential oils of: clary sage, to help change the mental negative mood; lemongrass, which is vibrant and uplifting; marjoram, for mind positivity and ylang ylang for its renowned antidepressant properties plus that wonderful fragrance. We&#39;re not claiming this product will sort all modern day problems, the car will still not start some mornings, the bills will keep coming, the kids will still argue and your boss will still be the same tomorrow but if this lovely little oil helps you along and gives you some moments of tranquil aromatherapy throughout the day we will feel like we have done our job.</p>

	This fantastic standing reindeer decoration is great for any house around Christmas time. It would make a great addition as a Christmas decoration as it truly does look brilliant. This fluffy reindeer is holding a long stemmed white flower and is wearing a buttoned up fur coat, a lovely warm bobble hat on his head, mittens, a scarf and warm brown boots. The reindeer has two beady eyes and a button nose with twig like antlers. This decoration is free-standing on its own wooden base with rods in the reindeer&rsquo;s legs for extra sturdiness. The reindeer stands at 75cm tall.&nbsp;</p>

	<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 9pt">Great quality dried orange slices. Ideal for adding to gift baskets or potpourri and&nbsp;used in soap making, candle making, floral displays and all manner of crafts.&nbsp;Our 25g jar normally contains between eight and ten slices but does depend on the slice size. This size would be ideal for a small craft project, to add to gifts such as homemade soaps or candles or to mix into a display of pine cones at Christmas. We also sell a fantastic orange essential oil you can drop onto each orange slice to refresh and give them a wonderful and long lasting aroma.</span></p>

This great ceramic stone face on legs peeping with one eye through his fingers has great detail from his cheeky head to bare feet. He is made from a coarse sandy ceramic, which gives the surface of the head a grainy but smooth texture. The texture and colour of the ceramic is then enhanced with a darker wash to colour the face, giving the head the appearance of age and of being outside as well as depth and an individual feature. Stone faces are ideal for inside or outside use and are rain and frost proof. They are hollow cast so can be weighed down further by filling with sand or grit if needed. They look great in the lawn, hidden between plants or on garden walls where they can be cemented down if required. Dimensions: Height 20cms, Width 16cms, Depth 13cms, Base 19cms x 11cms.

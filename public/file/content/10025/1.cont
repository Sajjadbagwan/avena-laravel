	Moss agate is considered the most powerful of the agates. It was the agate of warriors and is the agate that helps balance emotional energy. It helps the user to let go of anger and bitterness, so the emotions are balanced. Moss agate also enhances concentration, persistence, endurance and success and it is also a wealth stone. Thumb stones are also known as worry stones and are made of smooth, polished gemstones in the shape of an oval with a thumb-sized indentation. They are used by holding the stone between the index finger and thumb, gently moving one&#39;s thumb back and forth across the stone. These worry stones are ideal to use for crystal healing and are useful tools in meditation. This wonderful thumb stone measures 4cm x 3cm wide.</p>

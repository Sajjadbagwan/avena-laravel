<p>As well as the sword the Samurai employed a range of weapons such as bows and arrows, spears and guns. This fantastic Samurai archer is made from solid resin and stands 21cm tall. Samurai (or Bushi) led their lives according to the ethic code of bushido ''the way of the warrior''. Bushido principles included loyalty to one''s master, self discipline and respectful, ethical behaviour. After a defeat in battle many samurai would chose to commit ritual suicide (seppuku) rather than being captured or dying a dishonourable death. Our Samurai archer comes well packaged in its own box making a wonderful gift idea.</p>

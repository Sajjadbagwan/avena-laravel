	This lovely moon and star wooden ash catcher is made from sheesham wood, a hard rosewood indigenous to India, the wood for this item comes from renewable forest plantations. Each incense holder is hand made in India and has been finished with wonderful inlaid brass details. It is then waxed to bring out the natural colour and finish of the wood. The four brass holes firmly hold the incense sticks upright while burning which simply allows the ash to&nbsp;fall onto the dish, keeping your furniture clean and ash free. These brass holes are surrounded by gold stars and in the centre there is a pattern of a gold moon and a star. This charming incense holder allows you to burn up to four incense sticks and a cone at the same time to create your own favourite individual aroma and would make a beautiful gift especially when accompanied with Avena incense sticks. This incense holder is approximately 7cm in diameter.</p>

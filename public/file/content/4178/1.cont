	This cute looking pair of green dragons are full of character. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my turn&rsquo; dragons are small green dragons with white dots on their bodies. They have large boggle like eyes and large nostrils that seem slightly out of proportion, giving them a funny look. They have two small horns on their heads and one on their nose. The dragon on top seems very playful with and has an excitable expression on his face. It looks like the top dragon has jumped on the dragon on the bottom to play with him, but as a result has squashed him. This dragon has a concussed expression with his big eyes shut and his mouth closed. This pair of playful dragons are approximately 6cm tall and 8cm long.</p>

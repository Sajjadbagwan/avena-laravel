	This silver Mercury chime is made from a genuine hardwood with a blue wash and weather resistant finish with heavy duty coated nylon strings, whilst the tubes are a special aluminium alloy that will not rust and come with a one-year warranty. The silver Mercury chime comes carefully packed in a lovely box making it an ideal gift. This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance. It is hand-tuned to a universal, pentatonic (five-note) scale and acts in concert with the wind to create random patterns of wonderful sound. Ideal for indoor or outdoor use these high quality chimes are relaxing and meditational. The chime is named after the innermost planet in our solar system which, in turn, was named after the ancient Roman messenger god. Mercury is similar in appearance to the moon, with lots of craters and is normally not visible due to the glare of the sun; Mercury can be viewed in the morning or at twilight. This wonderful wind chime hangs at approximately 37cm long. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Mercury Chime Silver with Blue Wash Finish.</p>

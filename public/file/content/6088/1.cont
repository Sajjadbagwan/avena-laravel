	This gorgeous looking candle smells divine, with top notes of juicy figs that melts into tones of cassis and tropical green leaves, emphasized by a subtle fragrance of lily and jasmine on a base of smooth amber and cedar. This candle is also blended with quality frankincense and patchouli essential oils. The candle will give you hours of burning time to enjoy the beautiful fragrance. When in use place the candle tin on a heat resistant surface. Ensure the candle is kept away from any flammable materials and do not move the candle while alight or while the wax is molten. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not leave a burning candle unattended. This candle is suitable for vegans.</p>

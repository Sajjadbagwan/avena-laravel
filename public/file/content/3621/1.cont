	This great looking piece is a wonderful incense cone burner in the design of a tree man. It has an opening at the rear and is hollow. Place a burning incense cone or log inside to keep it out of sight whilst still allowing the fragrant smoke to magically rise from small holes in his pine cone hat. Alternatively this piece makes a great unique ornament on its own without the use of incense with his great detail from the leaves and bark to the small toadstools growing from the base. Dimensions Height 14cm. Each item is packed individually in its own decorative card box making a lovely gift idea.</p>

	A fantastic assortment of 12 gargoyles makes a brilliant set of the sturdy creatures. A Gargoyle, also known as a `Grotesque` in architectural terms, &nbsp;as they are usual both animal and human, serves as a gothic water spout usually seen on higher parts&nbsp;of a building or roof gutters to throw water clear of walls or foundations but&nbsp;they have&nbsp;also functioned solely as decorative pieces&nbsp;since the early 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. Originally the word comes from the French `Gargouille` which means `throat` because of their purpose. These gargoyles are made of resin and finished in a cream weathered stone effect. As&nbsp;they are&nbsp;waterproof they are ideal to put in the garden or&nbsp;on a patio or windowsill&nbsp;but are&nbsp;just as good indoors on a shelf, in kids&#39; bedrooms or on the&nbsp;fireplace. These gargoyles are approx. 4.5cm x 4cm. &nbsp;</p>

	This stunning looking bath blaster takes you to the alternative dimension of relaxation by creating the most psychedelic bath time trip ever. Created with patchouli essential oil and a cocoa and shea butter swirl, this benefits the mind body and soul.&nbsp;This rich scent incorporates lemons, oranges, green leaf and cinnamon. At the heart, patchouli, jasmine and violet are highlighted with notes of coconut, clove and cedarwood. Ending with deep accords of sandalwood, musk and vanilla. To use simply drop your bath blaster in to a bath of warm water and watch as it fizzes, releasing its perfume and essential oils. Your bath blaster can be used more than once by simply removing the rest of the blaster from the bath when a section has dissolved. Rinse bath well after use to prevent accidental staining.&nbsp;See our full range of Bath Blasters, Cocoa Swirls, Bath Tulips, Whoopie Blasters and more by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/bath-products/bath-bombs-melts/">HERE.</a></p>

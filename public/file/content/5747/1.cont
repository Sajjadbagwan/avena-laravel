	This hand painted orange shaped soap looks amazing and smells divine. With a colour that matches perfectly with a real orange, this soap has been spared no details, making it practically identical to the real thing. If you wanted to create a display of different fruit, this one is an essential buy. These soaps are often used purely for decoration as they look so fabulous and can simply be placed in rooms to release&nbsp;their fragrance and look pretty. As this soap comes presented in a lovely box it would also be great to give as a gift. As the soap is hand painted with harmless food colouring, before the first use of the soap rinse it under warm water for 2-3 minutes, gently rubbing off the colouring. Then your pure natural soap is ready to use. If it is just being used purely for its decorative effect, if kept away from humidity your soap will continue to look beautiful for many years.</p>

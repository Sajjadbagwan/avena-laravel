	Cellulite is common on many people and can build up on even the most slender parts of the body. It is however most commonly seen in women and builds up in areas such as the legs and buttocks. The appearance of the dimples and lumps in these areas is a sign of cellulite, not of the person being fat.</p>
<p>
	A cellulite build up on the legs and buttocks can look less than desirable, however, there are some simple ways to remove this. Massages with essential oils are a great way to remove the appearance of cellulite and gain the all-round benefits of a massage.</p>
<p>
	Our &nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/cel-massage-oil-a-natural-massage-oil-for-cellulite/2/">C.E.L. Massage Oil</a> has been carefully blended to use a fine mix of natural essential oils which are all excellent at reducing the build up of cellulite and preventing it from appearing on the skin&#39;s surface. All massages achieve better results when conducted using an oil to aid lubrication, so using one designed to remove cellulite would seem like the perfect solution.</p>
<p>
	The act of massaging the oil into the skin will promote blood circulation in the massaged areas and allow the natural essential oils penetrate deep into the areas you concentrate the product on. This will allow the oil to penetrate through the epidermal and dermal layers creating a long-term difference to the appearance of the skin.</p>
<p>
	The long term benefits of a massage are not only well documented, but are felt almost instantly when laying down on the massage table. The invigorating sensation aided by the effects of the oils will not only help to reduce the appearance of cellulite, but bring a spring back into your step and relax you in the process. Stress is argued to be a cause of cellulite also, so if you can relax at the same time then even better.</p>
<p>
	Remember to combine this application with a healthy diet, exercise and body brushing and you will be well on your way to cutting down on cellulite and remember, we are only human, so don&#39;t worry if you still have a few lumps and bumps here and there - we all do!&nbsp;</p>

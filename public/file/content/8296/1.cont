Buddha is the ultimate symbol of happiness, wealth and good fortune. Buddha&#39;s belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity and by stroking it, it is believed to bring much good luck.

He can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office etc. but avoid bathrooms and toilets.</p>

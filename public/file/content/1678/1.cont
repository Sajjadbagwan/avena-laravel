	A selection of blended, full strength fragrance oils that are ideal for use in oil burners, lamp rings or to drop onto potpourri, dried flowers or pomanders for a wonderful fresh and great quality aroma. These are top quality fragrance oils and not the cheaper variety, only a few drops are needed for a beautiful aroma that fills the whole room. To use in oil burners fill the dish or well with water and add a few drops of a fragrance oil or experiment with mixing some scents together. All the oils are in 10ml bottles here but we do have larger sizes on our fragrance oils page <u><strong><a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/fragrance-oils/" target="_self">here</a></strong></u> and the scents really do have to sampled to truly be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

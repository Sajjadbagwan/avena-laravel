	This festive wooden plaque shows a cheerful snowman family wearing scarves and festive black hats, all decorated differently to each other, in a wintery scene of pine trees and snow. The black wire makes it ideal to be hung on doors, windows, mantelpiece or on a wall. This charming hanger is finished with a little red bell attached to the wire and words reading &lsquo;Life is like a blanket of snow, be careful how you step on it, cause every step will show&rsquo;. This fantastic Christmas plaque would also make the perfect Secret Santa gift or would be great hung on a larger present as a gift tag for that extra special touch. Why not treat yourself to one of our Christmas plaques during the festive season to bring something decorative into your own home? This lovely wooden hanger measures 15.5cm tall and 9.5cm wide.</p>

	This fantastic extra-large oil burner stands up to its name; it is one of the largest oil burners we stock. The base has a lovely flower cut-out design which looks great with a flickering tealight especially in a dimly lit room while you&rsquo;re enjoying your favourite aromas slowly filling the atmosphere. The huge well allows you to burn your essential and fragrance oils for longer and is the perfect size for using and mixing wax melts. This ceramic oil burner was made with a lot of care and is good quality which makes it the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of alternative room fragrance or it would make a wonderful gift to someone as a &lsquo;starter kit&rsquo; paired up with one of our gorgeous oils, simmering granules or wax melts. This decorative oil burner stands 14cm tall, is 11.5cm in diameter and comes packaged in a plain white card box. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	Down an old, twisting Parisienne laneway where time seems to stand still, you will find a small pretty Caf&eacute; with a collection of small tables outside glistening in the winter sunshine. Upon entering you are overwhelmed by the aroma and the relaxing ambience. Sit back, sip your coffee, listen to the beautiful music and let the stresses of the outside world drift by.</p>

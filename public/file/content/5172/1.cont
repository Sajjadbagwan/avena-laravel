	This bright coloured fresh berry bath blaster is a deliciously wonderful explosion of sweetness, erupting and capturing your every sensation leaving you feeling sweetly scented. The bath blaster contains ylang ylang essential oil, known for its uplifting properties. It comes individually wrapped in cellophane making it an ideal gift. Your bath blaster can be used up to four times by simply placing it into a bath of warm water and watching as it fizzes rapidly releasing its fragrance and essential oils, whilst the bicarbonate of soda softens the water. Remember to only allow a portion of your bath blaster to dissolve and remove the rest from the bath to save for later. Please rinse any petals or decorations away from the&nbsp;bath immediately after use to prevent accidental staining. This bath blaster is suitable for vegans.

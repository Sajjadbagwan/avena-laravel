	This wonderful Feng Shui chime from Woodstock is named after fire one of the five elements within Feng Shui. It has five quality silver aluminium tubes and a black ash wood finish with a silk-screened wind catcher and genuine carnelian accent. The chime hangs at 42cm long, so would be suitable for indoor and outdoor use. The original musical scale for this chime was discovered through chance by casting coins and referencing I Ching.&nbsp; Feng Shui is a theory based on five elements; wood, fire, earth, metal and water, that are believed to help positive flows of energy.

<p>Glass bottles amber 10ml with a standard black screw on cap that has an internal dropper which inserts into the bottle neck as the cap is screwed on as found on most essential oil bottles. The dropper will then dispense the contents in drops when bottle is tipped up. The dropper can also easily be removed from the cap before screwing on meaning just a black cap can be used so the contents pour out rather than dispense by drops. The colour of the glass bottle protects the contents from light damage, keeps them fresh and prolongs the shelf life. Glass bottles are ideal for pure essential oils, fragrance oils, bath oils, nail oils, beauty products, massage oils or any mix containing essential oils. Height 65mm. Base diameter 23mm. Contents 10ml.</p>

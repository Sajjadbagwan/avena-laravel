	<span>This stunning hanging scroll candle holder is an authentic and unique decorative piece. The holder has a metal wire frame and is decorated lightly with red glass and acrylic gems. The votive candle holder is made from red glass and is removable, making it easier to place the candle in and also clean. The item can be used outside, but it is recommended not to be left out during strong winds or severe frost and snow. The total length is approximately 70cm with the votive candle holder being approximately 5cm in height and 7cm in diameter. This would be a lovely gift to give to somebody or even just to treat yourself.</span></p>

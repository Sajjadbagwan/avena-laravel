	Beautiful bloodstone Rune set. Rune Stones are one of the mystical worlds true mysteries. Nobody can be truly sure exactly where they came from and when. There are many theories on the subject but it is believed by some that they were first used any time from 2000BC to 100AD by tribes such as The Goths and other Germanic Tribes. Over the following year the use of Rune Stones spread throughout Europe with tribes like the Angles and the Saxons using them in the west and the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish using them in Scandinavia (among others). Our Rune Stones are of the Elder Futhark which was more commonly used in Northern Europe and are great quality hematite runes. Each set has 25 Rune Stones and comes in its own velvet black pouch with zip. Click image to see stones.</p>

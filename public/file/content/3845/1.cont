Simply warm this fantastic neck warmer in the microwave for two minutes to sooth, relax and comfort. This&nbsp;cat shaped warmer is very soft to the touch as it&#39;s made from a selection of luxurious soft furs for that extra cosy feeling, and contains treated millet seeds and dried lavender. This fun microwavable soft toy neck warmer is approx. 55cm long but also folds over to be quite compact for travelling.

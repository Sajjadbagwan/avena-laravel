	This charming Nordic character door stop wears a large red and grey hat that covers his face only revealing his rather big nose with a wire attached on the inside of the hat so it can be bent and altered in different ways. Under the nose of this comical looking character is his long white beard resting on his grey, furry body filled with a heavy bean bag. This cute Nordic doorstop would make a lovely gift idea and would also be great just to treat yourself to bring something festive and humorous into your own home. This little doorstop would be a great accessory in the home, helping to keep those popping open doors shut or others open to let the warmth of the house linger around. He measures approximately 33cm tall with his hat straightened up and 15cm wide.</p>

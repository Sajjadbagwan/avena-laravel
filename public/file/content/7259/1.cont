	This charming word block is created with love for all the terrific mums who give so much loving, caring, scolding, teaching, cuddling etc. to say thank you to them for their lives dedicated to their children. This delicate word block is created from quality resin, painted with pastel colours and is made of three square blocks held together. Each block has a letter etched on them making the word &lsquo;mum&rsquo; and each letter is covered with a glass dome as though the word was so fragile we wanted to protect it. The outer blocks are decorated with colourful flowers, whilst the middle one has a charming little bird on top of it. A small tag is attached to one of the flowers quoting &lsquo;you are terrific&rsquo;, describing a mum&rsquo;s work with the one word which stands for all the things she does, simply terrific! This fragile and decorative ornament measures 10cm long and 6.5cm tall, a small gift to say a big thank you to your mum!</p>

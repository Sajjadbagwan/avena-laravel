	A high quality and beautiful fossil presented in a sturdy gift box making it a wonderful and extra special gift. Ammonites thrived in the oceans during the time of the dinosaurs. They ranged from the size of a penny to the size of a tractor tyre. Ammonite fossils are cut and polished making them ideal for display in the home or a wonderful gift idea. They show the spiral shell of the ammonite in great detail and it&rsquo;s amazing to think that these are from approximately 175 million years ago. These creatures resembled the modern squid, but lived protected in their beautiful shells which are now fossilised giving you the chance to own a piece of history. Each ammonite is different but the presentation box is 80mm (W) x 80mm (D) x 50mm (H).&nbsp;</p>

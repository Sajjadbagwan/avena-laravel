Solid frog ideal for outdoors. Made from a heavy duty mix of resin and stone he looks great in the garden nestled between plants, in a rockery or beside a pond. Rain and frost proof these fantastic garden frogs are sturdy, solid and quite heavy for their size (not the cheaper hollow types). They are great quality and very realistically coloured. Dimensions- 120mm long, 180mm tall.

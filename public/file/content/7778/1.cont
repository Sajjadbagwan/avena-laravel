	These charming beany owls are made of various colours of fabric and decorated with holly leaves, little pearl looking eyes, pointy noses and small wings by their sides finished with brown little feet. One of these cute owls has a belly showing a fir tree by a bird feeder with a snowy background and the other shows a house surrounded by fir trees under the crescent moon and stars. Both of these festive owls are bean bags so they don&rsquo;t fall over when they are put on a shelf, on a windowsill, by the mantelpiece or even by the Christmas tree. These delightful owls would make the perfect Christmas present for someone who is a lover of owls and would be great to just treat yourself to bring something charming and decorative into your home during the festive season. These lovely beany owls measure approximately 21cm tall and 17cm x 12cm wide each.&nbsp;</p>

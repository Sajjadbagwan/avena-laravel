	Winchester glass bottles have a wider neck than Kingston bottles making them easier to pour oils into and they are great for mass produced products. We use these for most of our massage oils, carrier oils and bath oils etc. The amber glass protects the contents from light damage and keeps the contents fresh while prolonging the shelf life. Amber glass bottles are ideal for pure essential oils, fragrance oils, bath oils, nail oils, beauty products, massage oils or any mix containing essential oils. Height 110mm. Base diameter 54mm. Contents 100ml.</p>

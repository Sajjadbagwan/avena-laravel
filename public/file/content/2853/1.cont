	Revitalising, refreshing&nbsp;and soothing natural foot balm for problem, aching or tired feet. A cream made by carefully blending natural oils including refreshing peppermint which gives this product its wonderful fresh minty smell and is reputed to keep feet fresh and supple. Used for many years by distance walkers here in North Yorkshire who rave about its capability to prevent blisters but it&#39;s also great for use during any kind of sport or exercise and makes an&nbsp;ideal gift for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet whether through sports or work.</p>

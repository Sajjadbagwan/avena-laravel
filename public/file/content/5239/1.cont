The word selenite comes from the Greek &lsquo;Selenites&rsquo; meaning moon stone or moon rock. Selenite or &lsquo;mineral Gypsum&rsquo; is found on large salt plains and is created just beneath the surface.&nbsp; The selenite is said to have many healing properties and is shaped and sold in many forms including candle holders, decorative towers and palmstones.</span></p>

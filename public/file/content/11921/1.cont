	This stunning canvas picture is a splendid modern way to hang a great piece of art on a wall without the unnecessary bulk of a frame. This piece is designed by Anne Stokes and features the artwork printed onto a polymer canvas material and wrapped around a small wooden frame. This wonderful artwork consists of a lady dressed in white with long brown hair sitting on the floor of a beautifully green woodland area, caressing a pure white unicorn that lies beside her. This fantastic canvas picture can be hung anywhere from the bedroom to the living room and the attention to detail and the contrast between the white and the green makes this artwork a treat for the eye. Perfect if you&#39;re a fan of unicorns or if you&#39;re looking for a special gift for someone for any occasion. This decorative canvas picture measures H19cm x W25cm x D1cm and features on our 2 for &pound;9.99 range! &copy; Please do not copy text.

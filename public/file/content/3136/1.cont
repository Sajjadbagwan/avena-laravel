	An endearing long haired fairy sat upon a toadstool resting her head upon her knees. She looks peaceful and happy. The piece is light grey in colour apart from the cracked glass feature of green wings on the fairy. There is also a small toadstool attached to the larger toadstool making this a truly lovely piece. Another design of the fairy is also available on the website to make a delightful matching pair. The item stands approx 31cm tall. Ideal for any home or garden as is suitable for outdoor use.</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px">This dragon skull can just be an ornate piece for any dragon fan but at the same time is also a fantastic trinket box. Each dragon skull box is made from white resin with a bone coloured wash, with a darker wash adding detail and shading, particularly to the horns. The top of the skull easily lifts away from the base revealing an ideal storage space for those small, easy to lose items. Each skull box comes packed individually in a cardboard box. Dimensions: height 11cm, width 11cm and length 19cm. Storage dimension: 2cm deep and 9.5cm long.</span></p>

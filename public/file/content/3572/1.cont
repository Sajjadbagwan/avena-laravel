<p>Song Of India natural burning incense is resin obtained from the bark of trees and is the oldest form of burning incense and has been used for thousands of years during rituals and prayers. Uplifting aromas from natural resin can purify the air and create a wonderful relaxing and peaceful atmosphere. To use place a small amount of resin incense on a charcoal tablet, light the side of the charcoal tablet with a match or lighter, this will then smoulder around the rim and slowly heat the incense in the well which will then simmer away and fill the room with a beautiful aroma.</p>

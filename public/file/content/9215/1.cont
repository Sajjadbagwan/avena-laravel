	This eye-catching tarot box is made of composite wood, covered in fabric and lined with a velvet effect material with a velvet underside. The art work shown on this eye-catching box is a design by Anne Stokes, showing a beautiful angel with her wings open as if she was ready to fly over the misty waters. She is turning her head to us as if she is saying that even when we cannot see her she will be watching over our dreams to offer protection. Celtic designs decorate the side of this fantastic box. The black velvet on the inside of the box makes it a fantastic accessory to store your tarot cards to keep them away from negative vibes. This lovely angel tarot box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who practices tarot or perhaps a lover of angels and would also make a great addition to an existing Anne Stokes collection. The box measures 14cm tall and 10cm x 6cm wide and comes in a decorative card box. &copy; Please do not copy text - Avena product description - Angel Spirit Guide Tarot Box.</p>

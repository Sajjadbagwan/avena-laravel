	This lovely bath treat opens with notes of water lilies and has a heart of white lily, rose and jasmine fragrances. Travel back with us to a vintage time as frankincense and rose essential oils help soothe your furrowed modern soul.&nbsp;To use, simply drop your bath blaster into a bath of warm water and watch as it fizzes, releasing its perfume and essential oils. Your bath blaster can be used more than once and is suitable for vegans. Rinse bath well after use.

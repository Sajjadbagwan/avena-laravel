	A high quality and beautiful mineral presented in a sturdy gift box making it a wonderful and extra special gift. Agate was formed millions of years ago when hardened volcanic lava bubbles filled with enriched groundwater and created its wonderful patterns and colours. Agate can be cut and polished into many different shapes and sizes and these spectacular agate points are fantastic examples of the form. The base is left as natural rock and the top is cut into a point which is highly polished to show the rich colours and amazing patterns. As these are natural products no two pieces are exactly the same, giving you a unique piece. Each mineral may vary slightly in size as the product is totally natural, however the presentation box is 80mm (W) x 80mm (D) x 50mm (H).&nbsp;</p>

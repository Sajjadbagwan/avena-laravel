	Ayurveda originated in India thousands of years ago. The Sanskrit term Ayurveda comes from the word &#39;ayur&#39; meaning &#39;life&#39; and &#39;veda&#39; meaning &#39;knowledge&#39;. Over the centuries, Ayurveda became the science of life, providing a foundation for a healthy mind, body, and spirit. Ayurvedic medicine emphasises natural cures and treatments to restore a person&#39;s energy and promote healing. The same principles apply to Ayurvedic soap. This Medimix Ayurvedic soap has been clinically proven to be topically effective against skin conditions such as acne, body odour, prickly heat (milirialia rubra), boils (furuncles) and other skin infections. Its unique formulation of 18 herbs acts gently but effectively on many kinds of skin problems. This Ayurvedic soap contains no animal fat.</p>

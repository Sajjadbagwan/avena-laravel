<p>These great elephant oil burners are made from ceramic and finished in a mat glaze, except for the middle which has a frieze of elephants that has been finished with a very effective loose colour wash. The oil burner comes with a ceramic pot for the fragrance oils which hangs over the candle and releases the aromas as it heats up. Elephant oil burners are 110mm high with a diameter of 90mm and come packed in a nice white box.</p>

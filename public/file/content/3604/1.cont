<p>The practice of Buddhism began 2,500 years ago. Only within the past century have Western cultures reached out to embrace Buddhist wisdom, whose essence is to awaken and to serve. Blocking one''s mortal path to awakened or enlightened service are egotism, greed and selfishness, each of which leads to endless and needless suffering. The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism are said to move beyond earthly limitations and thereby reach Nirvana, a state of mind that is completely and permanently free of suffering. This oil burner features three of the famous praying Buddha sculptures, each positioned to hold the glass burning dish and is in a grey, stone finish and comes with tea light included, stands 12cm high and individually well packed in a sturdy box making a lovely gift.</p>

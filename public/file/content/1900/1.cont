	These lustrous stones have often been mistaken for gold, but are actually a type of iron mineral. Because of this it is commonly known as &#39;fools&#39; gold&#39;. This resemblance has made it the symbol of money and good luck. Does it work? Wear one, carry one with you, have them in your house or take one to bed to find out. All our stones are fantastic quality, rich in colour, smooth and polished. The average stone is 20-30mm but this does vary slightly as each is a unique natural shape and they make a fantastic gift idea.</p>

	This wonderful Zenergy chime is made from a genuine hardwood with a light cherry wood finish and has a silver polished aluminium rod in the centre. The chime comes supplied with a small mallet and one tap will emit a powerful tone of singular beauty. For best results, play the Zenergy Chime quietly, being careful not to dampen the sound by letting the mallet rest on the rod after striking it. Then take a deep breath and listen, relax, refocus and re-energise. Sounds such as this toned chime are often used in meditation and healing and can help us to focus and redirect our attention to the sounds within. The resonating sound not only calms and refocuses the individual, but can also focus a group. As such, it&#39;s an effective way to start a class, meeting, yoga practice or call guests to dinner. This Zenergy Meditation Solo Chime is approximately 18cm long<b>.</b></p>

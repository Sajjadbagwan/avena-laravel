	This charming ornament presents two happy looking owls huddled under an umbrella with their wings spread out on each side as if they were enjoying the rain, because no matter what the weather is, friendship lasts through the toughest times. Everyone who is lucky to say that they have a true friend knows that the quote etched on the umbrella is true: &lsquo;Good Friends&hellip; Rain or Shine!&rsquo; Each owl is very characterful, with lovely colours and designs, so detailed that it shows true quality work. This meaningful owl ornament is made from quality resin, decorated with attention to detail and measures 11cm long and 6cm tall. This sentimental little ornament is a truly lovely piece and an ideal gift for a friend on any occasion or no occasion at all, just to say thank you or show your friendship to your best buddy!</p>

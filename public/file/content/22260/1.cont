	We are not sure of the reasoning or story behind a &lsquo;cactus house&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s a love it or hate it ornament that some people would love in their home and some not so but we loved it so bought some as it was an end of range line and the last chance of stock so if you agree with us and want to own one buy now while we have stock as once it&rsquo;s gone it&rsquo;s gone!</p>

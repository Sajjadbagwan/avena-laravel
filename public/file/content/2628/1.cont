	Christina May Pine Tar soap is hard and very long lasting with a good white lather. Pine tar is an effective germicide and fungicide and is a traditional remedy for all sorts of skin problems. In fact many people rely on pine tar soap to relieve the symptoms of various skin complaints including acne, psoriasis, eczema and acne. All Christina May soaps are finely crafted and fragranced soaps, making them an ideal gift or addition in a gift hamper. A gentle and moisturising luxury soap. Please note- We are currently out of stock of 200g pine tar due to a manufacturing delay but as this is our best selling soap and relied upon by many customers we have kept the listing live and are sending out 2 x 100g for every bar ordered due to Christina May supplying us with 100g to tide us over. They are the exact same bar so obvious alternative for your own use however these are loosely wrapped and not as per the image so may not make an ideal gift.</p>

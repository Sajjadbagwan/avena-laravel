	This cute mug uses two colours of violet and pale blue merging into the each other to serve as a backdrop for a sweet little white unicorn with a pink mane and a purple saddle. Above the unicorn lies a thought bubble that reads &quot;I don&#39;t believe in humans&quot;. The mug is also adorned with white stars that are dotted around and just at the top of the mug on the inside there&#39;s a little rainbow smiling at you as you drink your hot chocolate or whatever your favourite brew may be. Ideal for all unicorn lovers that truly believe, and for all those that don&#39;t, well they don&#39;t believe in you either! This decorative mug measures at H9cm x W11.5cm including the handle. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Unicorn Mug Pink &amp; Blue.<br />

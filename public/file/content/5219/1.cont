	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This larger round owl is the father from our family set of three. He has a wonderful cartoon look about him, even though he does look quite serious and a bit grumpy. He has large adorable eyes and bushy eyebrows. He is looking like he is keeping a watch on what happening around him and is very much in charge! He is light brown in colour with a white chest and large beak with a tuft of tail feathers and detailed feet with claws. Made from quality resin he is suitable for outdoor use as part of our garden range (although we recommend that he is not left out during harsh, frosty weather and very bad winters) but he also makes a lovely indoors ornament and great gift idea individually or as part of the set. He measures at 15cmtall and 18cm wide.</span></p>

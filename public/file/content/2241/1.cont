	Scented with pure essential oils these granules are truly wonderful. For use in all our oil burners. To use place one or more teaspoons into the well of your burner and light the candle under them (no need to add water), the granules will then simmer away slowly releasing a wonderful and long lasting aroma of essential oil that will fill your room. This range of simmering granules comes in three wonderful aromas; Celtic Wonder, Dawn Glow and Divinity. Please note that the colour of the granules in this range is white/cream.</p>

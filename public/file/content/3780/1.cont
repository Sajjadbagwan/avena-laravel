It has a crafted star and moon design that will show off the glow from the candle inside creating a warm feeling. This oil burner would be a great decorative piece to add to any home or to be given as a gift. It stands at approx. 7cm tall and to use simply add a few drops of the fragrance oil of personal choice to a small amount of water in the dish, place a tea light underneath and let it get to work.</span></p>

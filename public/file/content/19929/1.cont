	A concentrated mix of essential oils to dilute into water and spray onto the animal to discourage annoying flying insects. This concentrated oil is ideal for the summer and handy to have ready for the hot weather. When animals constantly rub their hair the skin can become very sore and eventually break open to reveal sore areas where bacteria can thrive.</p>

	Directions: To use you will need a clean empty kitchen or bathroom cleaner trigger spray type container (or similar spray bottle). These usually hold 500ml. Fill the container with boiled cooled water and add five drops of Avena Horse &amp; Pony Insect Mix, shake well before spraying onto the animal as needed, creating a completely natural and environmentally friendly insect repellent. Using only five drops per 500ml water this little bottle goes a long way and is great value for money.</p>

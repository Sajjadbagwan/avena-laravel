	Sage revolves around the element of earth. Salvia eremostachya, also known as desert sage, is a well-known and widely used product among indigenous people of Central America, also known as the Natives, especially within shamanism. It is part of the purification ceremonies where these spicy plants are smoldered and their holy smoke is released. It stimulates the gain of visions and expels negative energy as well as bad entities. Scientific research has even shown that 94% of the bacteria in the room have been broken down after burning this herb.</p>

	So desert sage is a purification method that also changes your state of consciousness. Desert sage is a widely used product when it comes to the dawning and blessing of new phases.</p>

	Desert sage is distinguished from white sage by the smell that is released when you burn it. Sage has a sharp, very pungent smell, to be described as spicy. Not everyone experiences this smell as pleasant. It is therefore more functional than a pleasant home fragrance. Also useful: sage is used as a natural defense against insects such as moths and mosquitoes. In terms of smell, deserts are slightly less sharp and somewhat &#39;pepper&#39;, similar to mint.<br />
	When the leaves are dry, they can be burned. This involves tied desert sage with a length of 10 cm. In this way it is easy to ignite. As soon as the top of the beam is lit you can wave it with a feather and spread the sacred smoke over objects, people and in all corners of a room. The desert sage is bound together by a 100% cotton cord. Desert sage grows on the low prairie of California and is less strong than regular white sage. It can therefore be used for the daily smudge and for creating a pleasant atmosphere.</p>

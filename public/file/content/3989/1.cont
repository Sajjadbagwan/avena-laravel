	<span style="font-size: 12px;">Do you have a nosey neighbour? These wonderfully unique stones are new in and already proving to&nbsp;be a big hit in our shop. Made for the garden they can withstand the&nbsp;elements and are frost resistant but are just as happy indoors looking&nbsp;great on any shelf, desk, fireplace or getting interesting looks if&nbsp;placed looking out of a window. They are great in a porch or on a step and are a fun way to say `Keep your nose out` or can also be used as a door stop, paperweight&nbsp;etc. They are made from quality resin and have a granite type finish to them; they are&nbsp;solid, sturdy and quite heavy. Set in the centre of the stone is&nbsp;a protruding and realistic nose. The nose then has a metal zip attached around them! Why?&nbsp;We have no idea but love them or hate them they are selling fast. They are&nbsp;solid, durable and great quality making a fantastic and different gift&nbsp;idea and they now come in a fab gift box. These stones stand at 12cm tall and 11cm wide.</span></p>

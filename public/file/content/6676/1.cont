	Obsidian is a lovely black stone with a beautiful pattern throughout. Known as the stone of purity bringing balance, protection and security to the body, mind and spirit, it is also said to be beneficial for the skin and veins. Black obsidian is the birthstone for Capricorn (21st Dec - 10th Jan) and the symbol of safety. This gorgeous heart pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece. Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

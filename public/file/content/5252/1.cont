	This fantastic looking skull money box is made from quality resin and is finished in a silver mirrored effect. The money box has some brilliant detail from the hollow eyes to the individual teeth with the silver finish, giving it more of a robotic look. The bottom of the money box has a rubber bung so your savings can be accessed but this is more often purchased as simply a unique decorative piece. The silver skull money box measures 12cm tall and 13cm wide and comes securely packed in its own cardboard box making a novel gift idea.</p>

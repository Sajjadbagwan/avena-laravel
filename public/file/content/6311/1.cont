	This stunning looking shell measures approximately 13cm long and comes with a 3-4&quot; sage smudge stick. The back of the shell has been left in its natural, rough form whilst the inside has a beautiful silver metallic effect that shimmers in shades of purple, blue and green. The shell is perfect to use with smudge sticks as it will collect the ash as it burns, while also giving you a place to put your extinguished stick.&nbsp;</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This gargoyle is Snag, he has been formed in a detailed grotesque design and finished with black and grey colours. This gargoyle is sitting down with his legs crossed, knees up and arms crossed. He has small spikes running from his head down his back and two wings folded back. He has bright orange eyes that are looking high out of one corner, with a fed up look on his face. He also has long grey nails and a tail that is curled up behind him. Snag makes a fantastic ornament in a garden next to a plant pot as well as put in the house or conservatory, by the fireplace or towards a collection. He is made of solid resin and is packed in polystyrene for safe transit, then put in his own box. This ornament is approximately 8cm tall and 9cm wide. Snag would make the perfect gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures.</span></p>

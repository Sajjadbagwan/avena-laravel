	After a cold day there&rsquo;s nothing better than popping your chilly feet into a warmed up pair of soft and fluffy boots. These popular Bagpuss boots are manufactured in a luxurious high quality fabric that is wonderfully soft to the touch. They are filled with a new improved organic filling material with a hint of French Lavender. To heat, simply place in a microwave for two minutes to then slowly release soothing heat and a relaxing aroma while keeping your toes toasty. Bagpuss boots are a free size 3-8 so a great gift for anyone. Click on the product title to see more images of the&nbsp;boots in their&nbsp;packing and in use.</p>

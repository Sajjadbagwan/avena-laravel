	Orange calcite is a lesser known stone but still a very popular one, sometimes just for the fantastic colour alone but it also has soft, tranquil, happy and healthy properties as well as supposedly aiding the acquisition of wisdom. This is a solid piece of calcite made into a beautiful candle holder and would make a fantastic housewarming present. This is a natural rough stone product that is not cut to any exact dimensions, meaning the shape and size of the item can vary slightly from the picture shown as could the colour, shade and/or pattern where applicable. We always choose the best quality stone products from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. As this is a 100% natural product the size and shape of each candle holder varies, however the approximate size is 10cm x 10cm x 6cm. These are also quite heavy pieces with most weighing over 1kg.</p>

	Smug the gargoyle has been designed in a comical style finished with dark colours and a brilliant pose. This gargoyle is sitting in a black stone chair with his legs crossed and smiling with one of his yellow eyes shut as he scratches the&nbsp;inside of&nbsp;his ear with his little finger.&nbsp;Cheeky Smug is not wearing any clothes at all! This ornament&nbsp;makes a fantastic element of a garden just put next to a flowering plant or put on top of other ornaments, but as brilliant as&nbsp;it is to be put outside he is just&nbsp;as at home indoors by the fireplace or with part of a collection. This gargoyle is made of resin and is approx. 12cm x&nbsp;11cm wide and 17cm tall and is packed in a block of polystyrene for safe transit and then in a plain white box. He would make a wonderful gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures.</p>

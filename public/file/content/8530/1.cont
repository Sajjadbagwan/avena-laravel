	A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely and can be used in a wide range of healing. It can be used to analyse the human body such as locating the chakras. Our subconscious knows the answer for questions relating our body be it physical or mental, the pendulum helps bring this knowledge to our attention. The pendulum can be thought of as an extension of the intuition, since it is used to gain access to information that exists at the subconscious level of the Inner Being. The seven stones of the clapper are aligned in an ascending column, just as the seven chakras are aligned along the spine in the human body. Each chakra location has a unique meaning, orientation and healing potential. The Sahasrara is the Crown Chakra, represented by amethyst and violet in colour and is related to thought and self-knowledge. Ajna is the Brow Chakra, represented by lapis and indigo in colour and is related to intuition and clarity. Vushuddha is the Throat Chakra represented by turquoise and is related to sound and self-expression. Anahata is the Heart Chakra represented by aventurine and green in colour and is related to love and compassion. Manipura is the Solar Plexus Chakra represented by citrine and yellow in colour and is related to growth and personal power. Svadhisthana is the Sacral Chakra represented by carnelian and orange in colour and is related to creativity and enthusiasm. Muladhara is the Base Chakra represented by jasper and red in colour and is related to physical identity and self-preservation. This wonderful chakra pendulum would make the perfect gift idea for someone who would like to learn more about healing and chakras and it would also make the perfect tool for someone who already knows how to use this wonderful tool. The pendulum itself is 5cm long attached to a 19cm long silver chain.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(52, 45, 39); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 19.5px;">&copy; Please do not copy text.

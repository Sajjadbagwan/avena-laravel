	Dumortierite is the stone of patience, opening the doors of insight and activating the third eye chakra. It is a powerful healing gemstone that helps you to take the necessary steps to overcome hardships and find solutions to any problems you may be facing. This dumortierite heart is approximately 4cm x 4cm in size and comes in a small pouch: black, pink or purple. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

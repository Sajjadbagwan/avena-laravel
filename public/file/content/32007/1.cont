	This beautiful mirrored dragonfly motif is complemented by a cascade of multi-coloured crystals and finished with a good quality silver metal chain.<br />
	Every crystal has a hangtag with an individual description and sentiment relevant to each design.</p>

	This beautiful piece measures 26cm from the top hook to the bottom of the crystal and hung in a sunlit window will make the most beautiful and mesmerising dancing rainbow display although they are so lovely they can be hung anywhere and make ideal gifts for many occasions such as Christenings, Mothers&#39; Day, house warming, birthdays, Valentine&#39;s etc.</p>

	Designed and handmade in the UK they really are a beautiful and heart-warming gift. &nbsp;</p>

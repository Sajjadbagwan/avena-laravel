	A fantastic weathered stone effect Chinese Buddha with staff garden statue. This&nbsp; garden ornament is made from resin and has been finished in a mottled weathered stone effect. It stands 36cm tall and would look great in any garden, patio or conservatory etc. Garden Buddha is designed to be kept outside during all weathers, however we recommend it is not left out during severe frost or snow and is just as happy as an indoor ornament if needed. It is carefully packaged in a polystyrene and a plain card box.</p>

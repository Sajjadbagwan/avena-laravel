	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This is a fantastic new take on the traditional carved pumpkins we have at Halloween and it would make an amazing Halloween accessory in any home. This pumpkin character is made from metal and can be lit up inside with a battery powered LED light although it would look just as good as an ornament. There is a holder for the light in the centre of the pumpkin that is easy to access through the back. The pumpkin has simple carved features, arms and stands freely on its legs showing off his old style black boots. The legs are attached to a spring so that the top of the pumpkin wobbles slightly. To add even more character to the pumpkin it is holding a ghost balloon making it more fun than scary. The pumpkin character stands at 30cm tall. Please note that this product is not a toy and is not suitable for real flame candles, use only LED lights for effect. LED light not included.</span></p>

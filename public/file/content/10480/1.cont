	This solid marble elephant is coloured mostly black with hints of whites and greys and would make a great addition to any home placed on a shelf, windowsill, mantelpiece, table or even on the kitchen counter. The marble of this highly collectable elephant was formed over thousands of years in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains and only the highest quality stones are selected. The highly polished finish makes this decorative marble elephant a delightful gift at an affordable price. This smooth marble elephant measures H6.5cm x W3.5cm x L8cm. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

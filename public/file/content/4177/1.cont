	This cute looking green dragon is full of character. &lsquo;Let Me Think&rsquo; dragon is a small green dragon with white dots on his body. He has large, boggle like eyes and large nostrils that seem out of proportion slightly, giving him a funny look. He has two small horns on his head and one on his nose. He also has his wings open slightly on his back. He is sitting on his hind legs with one hand over his mouth with a cheeky thoughtful expression on his face. &lsquo;Let Me Think&rsquo; dragon is approximately 6cm tall.</p>

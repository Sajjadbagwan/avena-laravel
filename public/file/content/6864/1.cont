	George the dragon is the newest addition to our dragon collection and by far the cutest. George is a cheeky dragon with a comical look. He is more likely to get into mischief than cause mayhem! George the dragon is made from resin and finished in a grey stone effect with hints of yellow around his body and wings that looks fantastic. He is happy to be kept indoors and likes company but is also ideal to keep in the garden and can stand all kinds of weather although he may need bringing inside during severe frost or snow when he is unable to keep his toes warm and can&rsquo;t even muster a hiccup of fire for some heat! George is standing on his back legs with a very sly look about him. He has one hand over his closed eye with the other is in his mouth while he nibbles on his nail. George stands at 24cm tall and 19cm wide at his widest point. He is delivered snugly inside a card box and polystyrene to keep him safe in the post to his new home.</p>

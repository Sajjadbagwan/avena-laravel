	<span style="font-size: 12px">Bloodstone is said to aid a wealth of medical issues and to be good for blood pressure, kidneys, heart and lungs. Spiritually it is said to be a calming stone that can help alleviate stress and worry. Crystals or healing gemstones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your wellbeing. Does it work? Wear one, carry one with you, have them in your house or take one to bed to find out. All our stones are of a fantastic quality, rich in colour, smooth and polished. The average stone is 20-30mm but this does vary slightly as each is a unique natural shape and they make a fantastic gift idea in our mini drawstring pouches.&nbsp;</span>Part of our mix and match any 10 for &pound;10.00 range!</p>

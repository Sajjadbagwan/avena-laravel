	Tea tree is probably best known as nature&#39;s own antiseptic. Our tea tree skin ointment contains the freshest, top quality, pure tea tree essential oil making it an excellent antiseptic, anti-fungal and bactericidal treatment. The list of things this handy ointment is brilliant for is endless but going by customer feedback from the past ten years some of the more popular uses are for spots, boils, burns, corns, itching (from insect bites, chicken pox, etc.) warts, cold sores, dry skin patches and many more but one of the most popular uses for this product and the one we have received the best feedback for is when used on problematic feet including for fungal infections, athlete&rsquo;s foot, dry and itchy skin or just bad odours. Tea tree has been successfully used on nail infections and athlete&rsquo;s foot for years now and we even supply ours to local chiropodists.</p>

	Directions: To use this tea tree ointment simply apply to the affected area twice daily and rub into the skin.

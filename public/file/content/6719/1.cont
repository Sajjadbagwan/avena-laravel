	Gemini (21st May - 20th June) is a bowerbird mentally, who takes an interest in all sorts of different things. Anything that gets your mind ticking over will grab you. You constantly try to challenge your mental abilities and will make extra efforts to understand anything you put your mind to.&nbsp;The birthstone of Gemini is chrysocolla howlite which is a beautiful green/turquoise colour with a natural stone pattern throughout. It is said to encourage fairness and clarity. Howlite is also believed to be good for teeth and bones. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their properties and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

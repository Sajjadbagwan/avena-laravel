	Greenleaf scented sachets are the ideal way to fragrance any room. They are eco-friendly, 100% biodegradable and contain natural essential oils. These are the larger 115ml sachets that will fragrance a room for four months. You can enclose a scented sachet to make a greetings card more special (for the postman as well as the recipient), put one in the car to enjoy your favourite fragrance as you travel or throw one into the boot to eliminate lingering aromas. Many people take one to work to fragrance their staff room or&nbsp;office or to just pop into a desk drawer. They are an ideal gift on their own or a great addition to a gift basket and are often used in silk or dried flower displays making them smell realistic as well as looking great. Around the home they can simply be placed in any room, drawer, wardrobe, washing basket, bin etc. or on a radiator in winter for an intense fragrance boost and they are also an ideal way to eliminate pet odours. Please note some of our Greenleaf sachets have been discontinued but the fragrances are still available in Willow Brook sachets which we get from the same company and are the same thing but with a different name so larger orders may be fulfilled with both.

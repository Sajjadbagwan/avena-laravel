	This stunning looking bath blaster will make anyone&rsquo;s defence crumble with veggie friendly bath pearls, fresh neroli blossom and quality rhubarb fragrance! This stunning bath blaster is blended together using pure essential oils of rosemary and cinnamon for a warm and comforting bath. This bath blaster is then completed with a fruity explosion of red berries and ripe rhubarb leading to a heart of peaches and cream softened by the sweetness of caramel and vanilla. To use simply drop your bath blaster in to a bath of warm water and watch as it fizzes, releasing its perfume and essential oils. Your bath blaster can be used more than once by simply removing the rest of the blaster from the bath when a section has dissolved. Rinse bath well after use to prevent accidental staining.

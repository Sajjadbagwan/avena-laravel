	Sodalite is a rich blue colour with a wonderful stone pattern throughout. It helps balance intellect and intuition; helps clear the mind, bring joy and relieve a heavy heart. Sodalite is also the birthstone for Sagittarius (23rd Nov- 20th Dec) and the symbol of meditation. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our bracelets are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary from stone to stone and differ slightly from the image shown giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

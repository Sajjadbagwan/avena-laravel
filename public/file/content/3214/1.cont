<p>Each garden hare is made from solid resin and coloured to look like natural stone with great effect. They stand approx 19cm tall and weigh nearly 500g each so are quite heavy for their size and not likely to be blown over if outside. This hare with ears up would look great in any garden, patio, conservatory but is not just a garden piece as they make a great gift and are just as happy displayed indoors.</p>

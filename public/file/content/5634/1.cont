	These hematite iridescent magnets are fantastic and look great. They are very strong magnets and come as a bundle of TEN seperate magnets. They can be used as a bit of fun for older children or why not use them practically around the house for keeping things attached to the fridge etc. while also having unique looking fridge magnets? The average size of&nbsp;each magnet&nbsp;is 2cm x 1.5cm but this may vary as each shape is slightly different.&nbsp;</p>

	Not suitable for children under 36 months.&nbsp;</p>

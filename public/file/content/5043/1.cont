	<span style="font-size: 12px">Worry stones or palmstones are excellent for relieving stress and helping you concentrate while problem solving, studying, revising or meditating. Rub the smooth, highly polished stone gently in the palm of your hand or with your thumb every time you feel the need and it will absorb the stress from your body while your worries seem to melt away. Faced with a stressful situation, rubbing the stone is said to transfer energies from the stone which also absorbs the negativity associated with stress. We will&nbsp;always select the best stones to send to you and if your order is for multiples we will send you a selection of colours. Each worry stone is approximately 4cm x 4cm and comes in its own mini drawstring pouch making an&nbsp;ideal individual gift.</span></p>

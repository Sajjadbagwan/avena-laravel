	A piped swirl of buttery wonderment, a bath time extravaganza of pure lime and black pepper essential oil enlivenment to amaze and delight! A fresh, juicy cocktail of zesty limes, kiwis and crisp apples leading to a peaches&nbsp;and cream heart with floral accents of lily and jasmine, finishing with soft vanilla and musk. Use your cocoa swirl up to four times by dropping it in the bath and allowing a portion of it to melt. Your cocoa swirl will fizz very softly releasing moisturising cocoa butter. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your Cocoa Swirl to dissolve and remove it from the bath to save the rest for later. Wash any petals away after use to prevent accidental staining of the bath.

	This charming word block is made with pastel colours with the word &lsquo;Grandma&rsquo; etched on the base as though she was the soil offering supply and protection to the lovely flowers that grow from it. These blooming flowers have sparkly silver gems making an even lovelier gift. With so much attention to detail, this ornament really is a true quality piece. A small tag is attached to the middle flower with the quote &lsquo;Another word for love&rsquo; which gives this decorative ornament a heartfelt message to a loving, caring and protecting grandma to say thank you for all that she does. The ornament is made from resin and measures 11cm long and 4.5cm tall, just a small gift to say a big thank you to your grandma!</p>

	These quality raspberry tea lights are packed in a box of six. These beautifully scented tea lights have a refreshing, sweet and fruity aroma that fills the air with all the goodies of the garden. Bolsius tea light candles are produced using only the best quality waxes and using the latest production methods, which means that these tea lights always comply with the highest standards, are great quality, clean burning and long lasting. Do not confuse these candles with far eastern imports that will be cheaper but&nbsp;don&#39;t have&nbsp;the quality, clean burning or long burning time of these tea lights. These lovely candles are ideal for use in all of our oil burners and candle holders.</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This luxurious massage candle has been carefully blended using only pure essential oils and natural plant waxes; jojoba and coconut oil add a tactile and sensual feel to this warm wax. There is no need to worry about the wax burning you as this special natural wax blend has a low melting point. It will melt at around 45C which is like warm bath water. How to use safely: light the candle and allow it&nbsp;to burn until a pool of wax has formed, then blow out the flame. You&nbsp;can now&nbsp;directly pour the wax from the jar onto the skin. As with all massage preparation we recommend that a small skin test is done first to ensure that the person being massaged does not have an allergic reaction to the oil. This massage candle is not recommended to use on the face and please take special care to avoid contact with eyes. Why&nbsp;not turn down the lights and set the mood with some relaxing music? The candle in this heart shaped cup measures 4.5cm tall and 8cm in diameter.&nbsp;</span></p>

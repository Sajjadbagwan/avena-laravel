	This cute red dream catcher is decorated in cream and red glittering beads and clad with fiery orange and pink feathers at the bottom, embracing the essence of the flame. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Dream catchers are very popular with children suffering bad dreams, meaning that this lovely dream catcher is perfect for hanging over your little dreamer&#39;s bed or cot. Measures H22cm (top of hook to feathers) x W5cm (diameter of web). &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description - Pink &amp; Orange Dream Catcher Small.</p>

	This fantastic extra large fairy with dragons piece titled The Yearling is brand new to our web site but not our shop where it has had so much interest and great sales for such a large piece we have added it to our site too. The quality, colours and detail are quite stunning and although an expensive piece we have had nothing but great feedback and admiration for it from anyone who has seen it. The rather risqu&eacute; dressed fairy is sat on a pile of stones holding a baby dragon in one hand towards her face as if in admiration or even speaking to it. Around the base another, larger dragon looks on. The Yearling is a whopping 61cm (two foot) tall and has a wingspan of 55cm. It comes safely packed in a polystyrene block inside a sold card box to ensure it gets to you in perfect condition and delivery is free to anywhere within the UK.</p>

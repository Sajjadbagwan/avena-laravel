	A Fair Trade dark wood box with a lattice hinged lid made for keeping potpourri, dried flowers or similar fragranced products in. The lid allows the aroma to escape and gently float around the room. Would also make a great decorative box even if not used for fragrance. The box is 12cm x 12cm and 6cm high.</p>

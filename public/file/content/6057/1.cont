	This delightful sheep mug is made from quality ceramic and is highly glazed with a great detail and finish. With a dappled sheep&rsquo;s wool effect throughout, it features a black and white cross legged sheep with a handle of one his legs resting on his hip. This lovely piece is not just an ordinary mug though as it also has a lid to keep your brew hot! The&nbsp;mug is ideal to hold the perfect cuppa, just as a decorative piece or as a&nbsp;lovely gift idea.</p>

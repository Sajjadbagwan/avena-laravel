	Our cream/lotion base is the ideal starting point to blending your own unique skin products. The texture is very light making it easy to mix with your chosen essential and carrier oils. It can also be used on its own as a delicate moisturiser for those with sensitive skin or people who prefer to use an unscented cream. The lotion base contains polysorbate 20 which has a soothing effect on your skin; cetearyl alcohol which is well known to effectively condition and soften the skin; glyceryl stearate (derived from palm kernel, vegetable or soy oil and is also found naturally in the human body) which penetrates the skin and slows the loss of water from it by forming a barrier on the skin&rsquo;s surface; phenoxyethanol which is used in many natural creams as a preservative as an alternative to parabens and water to moisturise your skin. It has NO &ndash; parabens, artificial colours or animal additives. It has not been tested on animals and we don&rsquo;t buy ingredients from companies that test on animals or ever have. Ingredients &ndash; water (Aqua), sunflower seed oil (Helianthus annuus), polysorbate 20, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate, phenoxyethanol, carbomer, potassium sorbate, sodium hydroxide. Please note when blending your own products always ensure you know the correct and safe amount of essential oils to use and if you are selling your blended products you need to adhere to your country&#39;s laws and legislation regarding testing and stability of products for sale. &copy; Please do not copy our text - Avena product description &ndash; Lotion Base.</p>

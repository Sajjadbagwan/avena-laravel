	A beautiful natural palmstone cut from blue quartz which is said to help reinforce decisiveness and aid organisation, creating a relaxing and stress-free mood. Palmstones are a great way to ease stress and aid relaxation. Made from a wide range of natural semi-precious stones they are cut into an oval shape approximately 70mm long x 50mm wide. They are then highly polished making them the perfect shape and texture to hold. Each with their unique properties, they are also ideal to place under your pillow at night, use for meditation or chakra healing, simply as a way to collect some wonderful semi-precious stones or as an ideal gift idea and are perfect for slipping inside a greetings card or one of our drawstring pouches. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

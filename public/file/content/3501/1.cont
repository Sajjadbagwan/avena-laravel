<p>This red laughing Buddha sits with an ingot in his hand and a money sack to protect your gold and wealth. The Buddhas'' belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity. By stroking it, it is believed to bring much luck and fortune. Always place your Buddha in a position of honour and respect but never on the floor. They can be placed in any part of your home, but never in the bathroom or toilet. The laughing red buddha is approx 5cm tall.</p>

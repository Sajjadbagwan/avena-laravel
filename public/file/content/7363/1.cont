	<span style="font-size: 12px;">Crystal Healing is the perfect toolkit to pursue and assist a chosen therapy, energy or pastime. The music has been crafted to produce an ambience that allows the mind freedom for healing, visualisation and relaxation with consistent mood and texture. Crystals can take many forms, but regardless of their appearance on the outside, inside they have a uniform structure. Crystals transmit and receive energies to protect, heal and create love; can bring serenity to the home, peace to the mind and well-being to the individual. The very essence of the positive healing properties of each crystal is captured in the sound waves, each crystal producing a tone that is all its own. This album has been compiled by Medwin Goodall in close collaboration with various alternative therapists; an essential tool for both the professional therapist and the absolute beginner.&nbsp;</span></p>

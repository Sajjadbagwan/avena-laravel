	The best feature of our pure cold pressed plum kernel oil has to be the wonderful aroma. It has a delicious almond, marzipan fragrance which smells good enough to eat (please note that this oil is for external use only!).</p>
<p>
	The oil itself is a fantastic emollient and regenerator for damaged skin which adds nourishes and moisturises. It is rich in antioxidants and vitamin E, which can stimulate skin healing giving a natural healthy glow. Plum kernel is a very light oil which is easily absorbed by the skin and leaves no greasy residue as with some massage oils. It can be used on its own a truly luxurious massage for which the aroma would be amazing, it can be used as a facial oil to rehydrate and replenish the skin or blended with other carrier oils.</p>
<p>
	As the aroma is so wonderful on its own there is no need to add fragrances or essential oils other than for their different properties. Plum kernel is an expensive oil but is very much worth the extra cost. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Plum Kernel Oil (Prunus domestica).&nbsp;</p>

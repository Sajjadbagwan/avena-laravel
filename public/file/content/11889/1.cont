	This wicked wrist piece implements the classic tribal skull tattoo design printed onto a studded black leatherette bracelet and the pattern itself is made up of seven white skulls with a thick black outline and ghoulishly yellow eyes, with black tribal flames on either side of each. This accessory is worn on the wrist, giving the wearer an authentic punk-rock look. This is a great accessory for young and old alternative dressers, so whether you&#39;re rocking out a lot, or knocking on a bit, this accessory would be a great addition to your wardrobe. If this style isn&#39;t for you it parallels as a great gift idea for your alternative buddy. This cool bracelet measures at L23cm x W3.5cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

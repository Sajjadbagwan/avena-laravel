	Sitting Buddha statues inspire us to develop our inner qualities to achieve happiness, good fortune, and satisfaction in our lives. The laughing Buddha statue spreads joy and happiness wherever he goes!<br />
	Selenite or &lsquo;mineral gypsum&rsquo; is found on large salt plains and is created just beneath the surface. The word selenite comes from the Greek &lsquo;selenites&rsquo; meaning moon stone or moon rock.</p>

	This Selenite Buddha is 50mm tall and 50mm wide.<br />
	This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help.&nbsp;</p>

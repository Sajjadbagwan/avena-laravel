	This fantastic ceramic black incense cone holder is made for all kinds of cones, especially the bigger ones. It suits its name &ndash; the top lid looks just like&nbsp;the hat of a witch with star shaped and round holes within it to let the fragranced smoke escape while keeping the ash and the burning cone tidy and safe at the base of the cone burner. This wonderful cone burner is the perfect gift for someone who loves sitting down after a long day to relax and enjoy the beautiful fragranced smoke which fills the atmosphere. This lovely burner is approx. 10cm tall with a base of 8cm diameter. Why not check out our wide range of incense cones as an addition to this great cone burner?</p>

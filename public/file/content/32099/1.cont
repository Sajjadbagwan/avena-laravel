	This highly polished angel ornament is handcrafted from malachite howlite stone and stands on its own<br />
	This fantastic angel would make the perfect addition to any room of the home or would make the perfect gift idea for someone special as a small gesture to lift faith or for protection etc.<br />
	Named for its rich malachite-like colour, malachite howlite is aligned with the Heart Chakra and it is believed to calm the senses and protect us from harm. It is also believed to heal the emotions.<br />
	This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.<br />
	This wonderful carved angel measures H3cm x W1cm x L2cm, a handy pocket size so you can carry it with you anywhere you go.</p>

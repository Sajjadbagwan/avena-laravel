	<span style="font-size: 12px">This fantastic gargoyle is full of character. He seems to be a slightly rude gargoyle as he is picking his nose without a care in the world, but also has a cheeky look about him! This gargoyle is just the top half of the body, giving it a fantastic look when placed in a garden, in between plants or on a patio as it can give the illusion his bottom half is stuck underground. He would look fantastic anywhere in a garden, or even inside a house on a windowsill or in a corner in a room of your choice. He is made from stone, so will be fine to stay outside&nbsp;in all weather.</span></p>

	Great quality incense stick burner/ash catcher in dark wood. A standard incense burner with a small raised hole at one end in which to place your burning incense allowing the ash to fall and collect in the centre well. The other end is then flat for standing and burning incense cones or dhoop logs. Wooden ash catchers are 260mm long and still, at under a pound each, represent great value. As we sell so many of these designs may vary from the image or be plain depending on the current stock.</p>

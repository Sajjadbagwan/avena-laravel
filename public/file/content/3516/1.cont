	Rose quartz is a stone known for love and warmth which calms the emotions and uplifts the mind and body. This highly polished large sphere is approximately 45mm and sits nicely on one of our egg stands for display or is a perfect fit in one of our drawstring pouches for safe storage or for a gift. The wonderful thing about spheres is that they emit energy equally in all directions. This allows the natural energy to fill and circulate in the environment it is positioned. Spheres can also be used in a similar way to a worry stone, you can easily carry them in your pocket or bag taking advantage of the energy given off all day as the sphere is nearby or by holding or massaging in the hand. Two spheres rotated in one hand are very soothing and act in the same way solid stress balls do. They have a wide range of other mystical uses being closely related to and used as crystal balls as well as in massage and other therapies. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

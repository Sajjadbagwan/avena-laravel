	This stunning cat couple bronze look ornament is lovingly made with some great attention to detail and coloured with deep pink and brown shades giving it a fantastic weathered bronze look. This lovely ornament is made from quality polyresin so ideal for outdoors to place anywhere in the garden in-between flowers, in or next to larger plant pots or on stone walls etc. This charming piece is frost resistant and winter should not be an issue but to prolong the appearance and quality it is best to move indoors for the harsher months. It is treated for protection from the sun&rsquo;s UV rays although over time it will deteriorate so to keep it in top condition a lacquer or varnish is a good idea to apply at the beginning of Spring if required.</p>
<p>
	It would also make a beautiful and modern look ornamental decoration for indoors, placed on the windowsill, mantelpiece, shelf etc. plus this range is a very popular and lovely gift idea.</p>
<p>
	This ornament measures approximately 10cm tall.</p>

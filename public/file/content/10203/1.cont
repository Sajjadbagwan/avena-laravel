	A set of three jovial bath treats. Our bath blasters are one of the easiest, most convenient and fun ways to enjoy natural essential oils and aromatherapy in everyday life. They are pressed, rolled, sprinkled and dipped entirely by hand to ensure each one is individually beautiful. This fantastic set of bath treats can be given as a luxury gift set or, as they are wrapped individually, can be split up and given out as individual gifts whilst maybe also keeping one for yourself! Alternatively, they can all be kept for your very own indulgence and we won&rsquo;t tell a soul! We&#39;ll also include a special 25% off voucher which you can use on your next order or pass on if they are a gift. To use, simply drop your bath blaster into a bath of warm water and watch as it fizzes, releasing its perfume and essential oils and letting the rubber duck, frog and elephant escape and float on the water. Each bath blaster can be used for more than one bath if preferred and they are suitable for vegans. Rinse bath well after use.

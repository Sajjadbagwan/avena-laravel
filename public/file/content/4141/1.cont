	This beautiful sphere is cut from green goldstone which is said to be the stone of courage and spiritual direction. It stimulates physical and spiritual energies and encourages poise. It&#39;s also said to be the stone of growth. The sphere is finished with a smooth touch and polish. Green goldstone contains tiny shards of glass which glisten in the light, giving it a lovely shimmering effect. The sphere is a lovely deep green colour and would be an asset in any room. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

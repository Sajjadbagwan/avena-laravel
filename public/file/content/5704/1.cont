	This beautiful wooden, rustic looking trinket box is great for storing those small loose items that always seem to disappear. It would look great as an accessory in any home and would be lovely to give as a gift. This box is finished with black paint and white lettering on the lid saying &lsquo;Loose Change and Pocket Fluff&rsquo;.&nbsp; The box measures 12.5cm long, 10cm wide and 5.5cm tall. The inside trinket compartment is 2.5cm deep.</p>

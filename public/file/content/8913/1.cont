	The artwork of this fascinating deck of tarot cards was created by the artist, Antonella Platano, illustrating physical and metaphorical doors that can provide us with the key for entering the most distant and secret place: our heart. The concept for this fantastic tarot deck is one from Pietro Alligo at Lo Scarabeo and the symbolism of doors and keys is set into a very urban, contemporary environment of tattoo parlours and computers mixed with a fantasy world of centaurs and castles. &ldquo;Opening a door is also opening the mind, listening to the heart beat, thinking about the past to create the future and looking inside ourselves and opening up to others&rdquo;. The Tarot of the 78 Doors comes with instructions and contains 78 Arcana cards with a reversible image on the back of the cards of a golden gate and key on each end so could be used in both orientations. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This is a figurine of a Gargoyle known as Glugg.&nbsp; Glugg is sat crossed legged and looks to be excitedly reading a book which is clearly of great intrigue to him.&nbsp; Although naturally Gargoyles are not the most handsome of creatures and are known as being grotesque, they are said to scare off and protect from any evil or harmful spirits.&nbsp; Perhaps Glugg is therefore reading to plan his next strategy!&nbsp; Gargoyles were traditionally, and to this day are still, used in architecture in order to ward off evil.&nbsp; Glugg is therefore ideal for any home to provide an atmosphere of protection.&nbsp; In line with the traditional architectural use of Gargoyles, some people prefer to place their Gargoyle on a window ledge facing outwards.&nbsp; Glugg stands approx 13cm tall and 13cm wide.&nbsp; He comes presented in a plain box and is&nbsp;a superb gift for any collector of mystical objects.</p>

	This gorgeous purple circular dream catcher is decorated with clusters of cream and purple beads, along with an array of black, purple and beautiful peacock feathers, making this a truly stunning dream catcher. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Dream catchers are very popular with children suffering bad dreams. Measuring at H82cm (from the top of the hook to feather) x W21cm (diameter of the web) &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description - Dream Catcher Large Purple Peacock Feathers.<br />

	<span style="font-size: 12px;">Soft and warming vanilla cream combines with base notes of sweet caramel to give a popular fragrance a continental twist in this votive candle. This gorgeous votive candle is packed in a plastic tub and measures 5.5cm tall and 5cm in diameter. &nbsp;Fragrance has the power to stir emotions, stimulate the senses and evoke memories. This wonderful range of votive candles contains only the finest fragrances to capture each moment in an aroma. The ingredients for this luxurious range were sourced from well-known European fragrance houses with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity of fragrance. German-sourced cotton wicks are used and American soy wax that burns clearer, renewable, sustainable and kinder to the environment. All this means that you can enjoy these beautiful aromas in the knowledge that the whole manufacturing process has its heart in nature. This fantastic range of candles was designed with you (the end user) in mind and is the art of home fragrances so why not have your own little piece of luxury that doesn&rsquo;t cost the earth?</span></p>

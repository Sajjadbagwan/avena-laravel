	Chamomile is a soothing and gentle relaxant that has been shown to work for a variety of complaints from stress to menstrual cramps. The herb has a satisfying, apple-like aroma and flavour. The name chamomile is actually derived from the Greek kamai melon meaning ground apple. Concentrated extracts of chamomile are added to healing creams and lotions or packaged as pills and tinctures, made into tea as well as many other remedies. The chamomile is sold to us as food quality but we don&#39;t sell it as such simply because we don&#39;t have suitable food preparation/storage areas here so we can&rsquo;t recommend it for human consumption but it is ideal for many potpourri or aromatherapy uses such as floral scrubs, use in soaps, gift baskets, greeting cards, lotions, creams and a whole host of topical treatments. It would be fine to use for horses though as we do get asked this quite a lot. Supplied in a large clear plastic jar for decorative storage or to make the ideal gift. Minimum weight: 20g.</p>

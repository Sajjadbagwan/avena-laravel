	This wonderful round, dark wood incense and cone holder has been wonderfully carved to create the OM symbol. The holder has space to hold three incense sticks and one incense cone. It measures 9.5cm in diameter and is 1cm tall. The OM symbol is popular in Buddhism and Hinduism but means two slightly different things in each. In Buddhism &lsquo;OM&rsquo; is more of a mantra that is used in meditation. The sound that &lsquo;OM&rsquo; creates when elongated and repeated is believe to connect with the channels and winds of the spirit. In Hinduism, however, the &lsquo;OM&rsquo; sound is made to sound more like &lsquo;home&rsquo; and is sometimes spelt &lsquo;AUM&rsquo; with experts saying that these syllables represent heaven, earth and the underworld, including all the Hindu gods related to these three realms. It helps represent past, present and future while still in a conscious state of mind.&nbsp;</p>

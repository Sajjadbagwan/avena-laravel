	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This sweet looking pebble is beautifully decorated; it shows a brown puppy&nbsp;wearing a red collar, lying down in the centre of the pebble with two white bones at either side of it, and the words &lsquo;Puppy Love&rsquo; etched at the bottom. The pebbles fit perfectly into our small drawstring gift bags to make them extra special as a gift and so can be sent to someone on their own, inside a greetings card or as an addition to a larger gift. They are also small enough to be carried&nbsp;in a pocket or handbag&nbsp;for luck or as a reminder to keep the quotation in mind. We have many other quotes and animals in this pebble range including owls, cats, squirrels and foxes meaning they are also becoming quite collectable. The resin pebbles measure 35mm by 25mm and are great quality. They really are the ideal little gift and make everyone who reads them smile so why not spread some happiness and wise words today and send one to someone you care about?</span></p>

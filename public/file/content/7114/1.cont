	This fantastic owl planter would be a great addition for inside or outside your house. It has amazing detail carved into its shape creating the owl&#39;s wings, the look of its feathers and its lovely big beady eyes and beak. With the quality resin being left in its original colour of grey the planter has a wonderful rustic look about it. The owl planter stands at 11cm tall and 12cm wide, with the planter hole measuring 8cm in circumference and 9cm deep. The size of the planter makes it completely versatile, as it would be perfect to have anywhere in the garden while also being the perfect size to stay indoors and look pretty on a windowsill, mantelpiece etc. It is the perfect ornament for anyone who likes owls.</p>

	Sweet Honeysuckle is a beautiful light floral fragrance which is uplifting and helps any room feel like a breeze of fresh summer air has drifted through. This Ashleigh &amp; Burwood reed diffuser is a great natural way to fill your home with a scent you love. For those who do not like burning incense, or who prefer to be more eco friendly than using plug-in room fresheners, a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting&nbsp;and stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. With normal use, the liquid will last for up to 4 months! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and sit back whilst the fragrance is absorbed through the stick and evaporates across your room.</p>

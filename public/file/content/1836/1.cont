	In our opinion, this is the first reasonably priced&nbsp;British dried lavender&nbsp;produced in sustainably large quantities since WW1.&nbsp;Buy British!&nbsp;These&nbsp;dried lavender flowers&nbsp;are&nbsp;a grey, purple colour with an exceptionally strong and long lasting fragrance.They are great quality flowers ideal for filling lavender bags, lavender pillows, home crafts, and wedding gifts, confetti or for use in potpourri etc.</p>

	Avena dried lavender is totally natural and chemical free, itmay contain some broken pieces of stalk which is unavoidable when harvesting on this scale and this size is supplied in a 30g reusable plastic jar.&nbsp;</p>

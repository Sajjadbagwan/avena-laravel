	A very beautiful marble effect heart shaped stone. The stone is highly polished making it extremely smooth and with a gorgeous gleaming shine to it. A perfect gift, perhaps as a romantic gesture or ideal for anyone who is a fan of polished stones. The heart is approx 4cm wide, however, due to the stone being natural the size may vary per piece. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

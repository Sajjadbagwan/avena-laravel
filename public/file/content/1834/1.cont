	A dramatic dream catcher featuring a native Indian looking up to the sky with open arms as if praying where a wolves head is appearing from the clouds. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filters down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams and these wolf designs are now our best sellers. This dream catcher is approx. 40cm long from the hook to the bottom feather.

	Dragon eggs are actually roughly tumbled semi-precious stones that are cut and one face is highly polished to show the crystalline interior. Amethyst with its rich purple colour is one of our most popular gemstones. It&rsquo;s a powerful aid to creative thinking, spiritual awareness and healing which is also said to combat insomnia. Crystals or healing gemstones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your wellbeing. These amethyst dragon eggs are approximately 40mm across but as they are natural pieces each is unique and does vary in shape and size slightly. We keep a selection of such stones in our shop and cherry pick the best for online orders meaning you are assured of a lovely piece. &nbsp;Read our interesting history and uses of amethyst blog by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/blog/2014/11/the-history-and-uses-of-amethyst/" target="_self">here.</a></p>

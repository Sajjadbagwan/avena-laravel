	This grey stone effect Buddha is made from quality resin. The Buddha is sitting in the popular meditation pose and has both hands resting face up in his lap, with one hand on top of the other. He is seated with both of his ankles tucked in, known as double lotus, a popular position when studying the art of yoga. This statue signifies inner wisdom, emotional balance, and clarity.&nbsp;This is a stunning looking Buddha and it would make a fantastic feature. With it being made from resin it is suitable for indoor and outdoor use, however we do not recommend it is left outside in severe frost. This Buddha measures 30cm tall and 21cm wide.</p>

	This two piece novel brass incense cone burner is made to hold any kind of incense cones. It has patterned holes within the lid to let the fragranced smoke escape while keeping the ash and the burning cone tidy and safe in the bottom base. This cute little burner has three brass legs to stand on and an additional hole at the very top of the burner. This burner is a fantastic gift to extend someone&#39;s brass collection or for someone who likes to sit back and relax while the beautifully scented smoke fills the atmosphere in any room of the house. This great little burner is approx. 6cm tall. Why not see our incense cones range as an addition to this wonderful holder?</p>

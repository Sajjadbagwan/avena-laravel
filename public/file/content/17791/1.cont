	This fantastic soap, crafted with pure essential oils of orange and mandarin, will make you feel zesty and fruity as you are drenched in a citrus blizzard. This wonderful soap can be used like any normal bar of soap but is much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with or alternatively, rub the bar onto a sponge. This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being hand made the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured.</p>

	Ylang ylang aroma is warm, sweet and clove-like, it is relaxing and is thought to have aphrodisiac properties. Avena fragrance oils are high quality full strength oils which really do have to be sampled to be fully appreciated. Ideal for use in oil burners, lamp rings, to drop onto potpourri or dried flowers etc to refresh a fading aroma. To use in oil burners fill the dish/well with water and add a few drops of oil; due to the quality of our oils 5-10 drops should suffice but you can add more for a stronger aroma or experiment with mixing some scents together.<br />

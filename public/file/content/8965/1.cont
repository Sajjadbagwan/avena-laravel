	This stunning skull is made from quality resin with a design of playing cards associated with the &lsquo;dead man&rsquo;s hand&rsquo; which is currently described as a two-pair poker hand consisting of the black aces and black eights, along with an unknown hole card which were reportedly held by the &lsquo;Old West&rsquo; folk hero, lawman and gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok when he was murdered. This fantastic skull has some brilliant detail from the hollow eyes and the life-like teeth to the tiny cracks, and is indeed a very decorative ornament. This eye catching skull would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of weird and wonderful things and would make a great addition to an existing skull collection. This skull measures approximately 11.5cm tall, 14cm long, 10cm wide at the widest points and comes packaged in a plain card box with polystyrene for safe shipping. &copy; Please do not copy text- Avena product description - Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand Skull.</p>

<p>This beautiful oil burner is extremely dark green, in fact almost black. The fairy is kneeling on one knee holding out her arm holding two flowers. Behind the fairy are a large and small toadstool, and these, along with the wings of the fairy support the glass dish for burning your choice of oil. The oil burner comes packaged in its own box and with one tealight. This is a lovely addition to any home and an ideal present. It stands approx 12cm tall. Burning oils, granules and tea light candles are also available on the website.</p>

	These maximum strength scented granules are for use in all oil burners. The aromas from any of our top quality burning granules are truly wonderful and long lasting whilst being&nbsp;less hassle and easier to use than oils. Avena granules come packaged as 130g in amber glass jars for ease of use&nbsp;which prolongs the aroma and colour&nbsp;and prevents&nbsp;worry about splitting plastic bags. To use simply place one or more teaspoons into the well of your burner and light the candle underneath (no need to add water). The granules then heat and will simmer away slowly releasing a wonderful and long lasting aroma that will fill your room. After use, just shake the used (cooled) granules into a bin and replenish as needed. &nbsp;Choose from our wide range of fragrances.</p>

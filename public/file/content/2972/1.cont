	<span>Wintergreen cream is another wonderful unisex cream that is ideal for weathered or chapped hands and feet and is widely used by manual workers, people working outside a lot or with products that may make the hands dry. Quite a strong cream with a medicated aroma that is designed more to ease problems rather than be a nice looking or smelling beauty product. Ideal for gardeners or craft workers when massaged into hands, for aching feet or rub a small amount into the chest if blocked up, with a sore throat or having general cold symptoms. Rub onto leg muscles before sport especially in cold weather.</span></p>

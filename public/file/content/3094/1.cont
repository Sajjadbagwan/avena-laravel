<p>Dorothia is a witch but she is a very pretty one. She has long green hair, witches hat and is knelt on a stone base holding a broomstick. The detail is fantastic from the design on the half moon on her hat to the intricate pagan type pattern on her bodice. She is 80mm tall and a must for any collection or makes an ideal gift packed in her purple patterned box.</p>

	This is a beautiful wooden incense burner and cone dish combined, featuring various designs carved into the hexagonal shaped wood. It is a design which allows you to burn up to three incense sticks and one incense cone simultaneously. The specially designed holes firmly hold your incense stick in place when burning, allowing the ash to fall onto the plate and keeping your furniture free from any unwanted mess. Approx 12 cm diameter.</p>

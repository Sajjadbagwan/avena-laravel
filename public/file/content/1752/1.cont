Clary sage is a popular aromatic perfume with a warming, relaxing and long lasting fragrance. It has properties that induce a sense of well being and ease depression so it&#39;s ideal for massaging into the temples on those long days or when feeling down. It is also well known for reducing hot flushes, night sweats, P.M.T. and for female&nbsp;well-being in general. Clary sage massage oil is also great for use during labour and childbirth. Each bottle contains a dropper so the oil does not pour out quickly. A ready to apply oil, place a few drops in palm of hand and apply to the temples, neck, lower back or pelvic area as needed. Makes an ideal gift for anyone about to give birth or for any &#39;dad to be&#39; giving him something constructive to do during labour.&nbsp; <strong>Clary sage products should not be used by pregnant women who are under 38 weeks pregnant.</strong></p>

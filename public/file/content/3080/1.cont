<p>A superb high quality Dark Angel figurine which is also a candle holder.&nbsp; At the nape of the neck of the angel there is carved a place for a candle to be held securely. &nbsp;This could make the piece an unusual table decoration or simply an ornate candle holder.&nbsp; The angel is hauntingly gothic.&nbsp; There are no facial features to the dark angel but her head is bowed with her hands in a prayer stance holding a red rose.&nbsp; More red roses are found entwined around the angels cloak.&nbsp; Her huge wings appear to offer her protection and comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approx 6cm tall and wing diameter of 14cm.&nbsp; A beautiful piece which is perfect for display in any room or an ideal gift idea.</p>

	These meaningful little ornaments are all made with a message to describe our home, where we come from, grow up or build together, which is the strongest base in our life where we can be ourselves with unconditional love towards each other and where we feel safe and peaceful. Each ornament is made from quality resin and beautifully designed with colourful houses and trees, with quotes etched on their bases: &lsquo;Home is where our story begins&rsquo;, &lsquo;Home is where they love you no matter what&rsquo; and &lsquo;Our home is a little piece of heaven&rsquo; making them a sentimental decoration for the house or a charming housewarming gift idea. Each block measures 7cm tall and 4cm wide, a small ornament for a big part of our lives!</p>

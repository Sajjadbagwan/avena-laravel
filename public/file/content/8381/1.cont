	Our ready to apply arnica ointment is reputed to be a homeopathic anti-inflammatory that may be used for traumatic injuries such as sprains and strains to joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons and for backache etc. Arnica is probably best known as a pain relieving remedy that counteracts inflammation and reduces swelling and discoloration on bruises, aiding healing and relieving pain. When blood vessels are broken, blood escapes and comes to rest in the surrounding tissue. This trapped blood is responsible for black and blue bruise mark. Arnica may reduce these marks by helping the body reabsorb this trapped blood.<br />
	<br />
	Directions: rub a small amount of Arnica ointment onto the affected areas (bruises or aching muscles) twice daily. Note: do not use on broken skin.<br />

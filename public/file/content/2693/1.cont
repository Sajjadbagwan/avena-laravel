	A wonderful orange and red resin sunburst suncatcher. A beautiful piece ideal for hanging indoors or outside, makes a great wall decoration and looks great hung in a window where the sunlight can catch the fantastic colours. The actual sun measures 202mm across and the hanging string and hook&nbsp;are 330mm in total. Each sun is made from resin and metal with an orange/red nugget suspended inside.&nbsp;</p>

	This elegant looking piece of white selenite, with its jagged markings is a delicate natural mineral that is a lovely piece of decoration and also has a lot of meaning behind it. Selenite is used for healing, power, love and protection and gets its name from the Greek goddess of the moon because of its moon-like glow. It is thought that if selenite is passed between lovers it will aid reconciliation. Placing selenite at the four corners of your home is believed to create a safe and peaceful environment as well as the selenite making a wonderful protection stone. This point is approximately 15cm tall with a base approximately around 4cm x 3cm (sizes may vary). This is a natural rough stone product that is not cut to any exact dimensions, meaning the shape and size of the item can vary slightly from the picture shown as could the colour, shade and/or pattern where applicable. We always choose the best quality stone products from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

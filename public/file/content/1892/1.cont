	A simple but trendy light wood fish soap dish made from quality wood and designed to allow water to drain away and therefore preserve the life of your soap bars. Each soap dish is packed in a clear cellophane bag and would make a lovely gift on its own, or why not accompany it with a bar of natural soap? Also ideal for including in a bathroom gift set or hamper.</p>

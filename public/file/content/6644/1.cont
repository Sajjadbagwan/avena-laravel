	Carnelian is a wonderful deep red colour,&nbsp;thought to be&nbsp;a good balancer and it connects you with your inner self,&nbsp;lifting the emotions and giving courage. It is also said to benefit the kidneys, lungs and liver. Carnelian is the birthstone of Virgo (22nd Aug - 22nd Sept) and the symbol of joy. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our bracelets are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary from stone to stone and differ slightly from the image shown giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

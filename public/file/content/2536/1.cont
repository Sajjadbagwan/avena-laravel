	Fly &amp; midge spray is ideal for the summer and handy to have ready for the hot weather. When animals constantly rub their hair the skin can become very sore and eventually break open to reveal sore areas where bacteria can thrive. This 100% natural spray contains essential oils known to deter annoying flying insects such as midges, bots, horse flies, black flies and face flies and can be used on horses and ponies but is also good to use on dogs.</p>

	Directions: always shake well before use and spray directly on the animal from about 8 inches distance, avoiding the eyes and any broken skin.</p>

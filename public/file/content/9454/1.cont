	This spooky mummy is wrapped in many layers of linen cloths with a spider crawling up his side, all made of plastic. On the front of the base there is a solar panel which powers the rocking motion. The mummy&rsquo;s hips are swaying from side to side and his arms are moving up and down in the same rhythm. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light make the rocking movement, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not toys, and are not suitable for children under three years old due to small parts. Each mummy comes in a clear plastic box and she is 10cm tall and would make the perfect Halloween decoration. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	George the dragon is the newest addition to our dragon collection and is by far the cutest. In a variety of poses, shapes and sizes George is a cheeky dragon with a comical look. He is more likely to get into mischief rather than cause mayhem! George the dragon is made from resin and finished in a grey stone effect with hints of yellow around the body that makes him look fantastic. He is happy to be kept indoors and likes company but is also ideal to keep in the garden and can stand all kinds of weather although he may need bringing inside during severe frost or snow when he is unable to keep his toes warm and can&rsquo;t even muster a hiccup of fire for some heat. This cheeky George is taking time out from his usual mischief to sit down to practice yoga and clear his thoughts. He is 21cm tall, 14x13cm wide at the widest points and weighs just under 1kg . George is delivered snugly inside a card box and polystyrene to keep him safe in the post to his new home. &copy; Please do not copy text.

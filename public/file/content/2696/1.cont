	This Ashleigh &amp; Burwood reed diffuser is a great natural way to fill your home with&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;traditional scents of Christmas. For those who don&#39;t like burning incense or who prefer to be more eco friendly than using plug-in room fresheners a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting&nbsp;and stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. With normal use, the liquid will last up to 4 months so will easily last you through the festive season and beyond! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and sit back while the fragrance is absorbed through the stick and evaporates across your room. A warming cinammon and apple aroma to fill your room with a beautiful festive feel. Supplied in excellent quality tubes these diffusers also make wonderful gifts.</p>

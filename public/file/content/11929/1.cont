	Our lanolin is produced in China, where most of the world&rsquo;s wool is processed today, from the multi-stage refining of wool grease, a natural, renewable raw material which is obtained from the scouring (washing) of raw wool. The origins of the bulk of the wool is Australia and New Zealand and it is manufactured to fully meet the requirements of the current European Pharmacopoeia and existing national requirements for pesticide residues. We tend to use wool grease from merino fine wool which provides for a good quality lanolin. Avena lanolin has been refined to a point where trace pesticide residues are practically undetectable, so you can buy with confidence. The high purity of our lanolin, without sacrificing product colour, makes it ideal for topical pharmaceutical preparations, suppositories, lip products and body creams and lotions. Lanolin can be used in the most exacting applications where colour, odour and purity are critical and is still bought today by many customers to use directly on the hands and feet especially for rough, dry and cracked skin. The intensive healing of natural lanolin assists in restoring the hands and feet to a smooth, healthy condition. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This fascinating embossed journal contains blank pages of acid free, sustainable forest paper. The art work of Anne Stokes illustrates the Midnight Messenger who is wearing a white dress accessorised with a white cloak, gloves and a pentagram design tiara. This beautiful white witch is holding a lantern to supply light on this dark wintery night and travels in secret in a snow laden forest in the company of a wise white owl. This gorgeous embossed journal of the Midnight Messenger and the owl would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of owls, witches or any kind of creatures created by our fantasies. This designer journal is 17.5cm long and 12.5cm x 1.5cm wide and comes packaged in cellophane.&nbsp;</p>

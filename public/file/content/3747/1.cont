	</span></u>I don&#39;t know how I found you but I&#39;m so glad I did. My life was turned upside down a few months ago destroying not only my confidence but my belief in myself and my values. Your CDs have continually motivated me, giving me strength and encouragement and the wonderful thing is I can take them with me anywhere I go, listening to you at anytime of the day or night - I just can&#39;t thank you enough.</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 9pt"><o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>

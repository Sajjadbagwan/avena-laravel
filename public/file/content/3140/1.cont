<p>A beautiful fairy made from fine resin sitting on a rock with great detailed plants and flowers wearing a pale blue dress with matching blue wings and long dark flowing hair. The moon crescent is then arched above her in a subtle yellow with tiny silver stars dotted the length of it. The fairy and moon is finished in bright fantastical colours with great attention to detail and each, each piece comes packaged in its own box, is 15cm high and makes a lovely gift.</p>

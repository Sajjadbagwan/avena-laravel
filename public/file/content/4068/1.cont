	This solid resin gargoyle has been designed in a comical style finished with detailed colouring and a&nbsp;brilliant pose. Spatz the gargoyle is lying on his belly with his legs crossed and his left arm holding his head whilst looking up in the sky with his yellow eyes,&nbsp;and a grin on his face as though he is waiting for one of his tricks to happen. Comically, all he is wearing are his brown shoes and&nbsp;the long black hair covering his back. This ornament&nbsp;makes a fantastic element of a garden just put next to a flowering plant or put on top of other ornaments, but as brilliant as&nbsp;it is to be put outside he is just as at home indoors by the fireplace or with part of a collection. This gargoyle is approx. 14cm long, 7cm wide and 6cm tall and is packed in a block of polystyrene for safe transit and then in a plain white box. He would make a wonderful gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures.</p>

	This solid resin gargoyle has been designed in a comical style finished with detailed colouring and a brilliant pose. Spadge the gargoyle is standing with his legs bent, with one hand pointing down to the floor and the other rubbing his chin with a far-away look in his yellow eyes as though he is deep in thought and wondering what has happened. Naughtily, all Spadge is wearing are his brown shoes and his long black hair is covering his back but letting his wings stick out. This ornament is a fantastic element of a garden just put next to a flowering plant or put on top of other ornaments, but as brilliant as&nbsp;it is to be put outside he is just as at home indoors by the fireplace or with part of a collection. This gargoyle is approx. 8cm x 9cm wide and 13cm tall and is packed in a block of polystyrene for safe transit and then in a plain white box. He would make a wonderful gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures.</p>

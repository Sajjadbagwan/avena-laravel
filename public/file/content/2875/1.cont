	These delightful cute mini stone washed oil burners come in three colours, black, brown and blue. They are smaller than the oil burners which we normally sell still using the normal tea-ligh candle making them ideal for burning oils or simmering granules and are a handy size, not taking up too much room which therefore allows for a delicate aroma to eminate into your room. The oil burner is approx 8cm high with a 7cm diameter.</p>

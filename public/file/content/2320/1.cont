	A large wall plaque in a wooden triangular frame containing a canvas with a fantastic image of an Indian chief. The plaque then has feathers dangling from the bottom to add to the authentic look. A great looking addition to any wall and a wonderful gift idea. The plaque itself measures 405mm tall and with the feathers is approximately 600mm tall.</p>

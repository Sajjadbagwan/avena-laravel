	This beautiful nativity scene is a wonderful collection to have displayed in your house around the festive period. All of the characters in the set are made from resin and are brightly coloured, finished with a knitted look. The set contains the Holy family, one shepherd with a lamb, the three kings and an angel holding a star. All the pieces in the nativity stand separately, so you can display the scene however you like, with no limits to space. The approximate height for each character is 13cm tall.&nbsp;</p>

	This hand painted nectarine shaped soap looks amazing and smells divine. You&rsquo;re probably wondering right now if that is a real nectarine stone in the centre. Well, believe it or not, it is! All the stones, stalks and cloves the artists use are real, guaranteeing the soaps look exactly like the real&nbsp;thing, right down to the tiniest details. Why not give everyone a surprise with this exquisite soap<em>?</em> These soaps are often used purely for decoration as they look so fabulous and can simply be placed in rooms to release&nbsp;their fragrance and look pretty. As this soap comes presented in a lovely box it would also be great to give as a gift. As the soap is hand painted with harmless food colouring, before the first use of the soap rinse it under warm water for 2-3 minutes, gently rubbing off the colouring. Then your pure natural soap is ready to use. If it is just being used purely for its decorative effect, if kept away from humidity your soap will continue to look beautiful for many years.</p>

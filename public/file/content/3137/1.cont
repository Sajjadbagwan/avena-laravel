	A beautifully detailed fairy of fantastic quality, Serena is the ultimate piece for any collection. The solid base of leaves and flowers is 29cm long and the height to the tip of the wings is a massive 38cm but no detail or quality is lost in the size and she weighs 2.8kg out of the box so is a solid, heavy item. Serena is knelt on a bed of leaves resting on a magical toadstool and gazing in deep thought. A much commented on piece in our shop and very popular. As with all our fairies Serena is very carefully packed in a pictured gift box. Click the title to see more images.&nbsp;</p>

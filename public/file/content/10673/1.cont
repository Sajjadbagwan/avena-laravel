	This solid onyx turtle would make a great addition to any home placed on a shelf, windowsill, mantelpiece, table or even on the kitchen counter. Onyx is formed over thousands of years, mostly in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains. An onyx forms in parallel bands with a variety of colours mainly greens and browns, and it is often used for carving. The highly polished finish makes this decorative onyx turtle a delightful gift at an affordable price. This smooth onyx turtle measures H3.5cm x W6.5cm x L8cm. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Onyx Turtle Large.</p>

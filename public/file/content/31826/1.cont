	Mookaite is said to give strength, inner calm and a thirst for adventure. In this way it is believed to keep a healthy balance between external stimulation and inner life.<br />
	This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery, but we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of the item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. The average size for each tumblestone is approximately 2cm long.<br />

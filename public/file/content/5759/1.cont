	This brilliant cartoon-ish reindeer ornament is great to display in any house around the festive season, bringing character to anywhere it is placed. The word &rsquo;Believe&rsquo; has been made to look like it has been carved from a tree stump. The reindeer is sat holding the end few letters of the word with a grin on his face. The reindeer is very cute and slightly comical wearing his Christmas tree top, bow tie and big brown boots. He has large eyes, a button nose and a cheeky smile upon his face with single Christmas decorations decorating his antlers. This ornament is free-standing and very sturdy. It measures 22cm long and 12cm tall.</p>

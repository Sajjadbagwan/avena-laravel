	This is YooHoo the endangered bushbaby with lots of cuddles to give. He is from the original &#39;YooHoo and Friends&#39; collection and is now fully microwavable. In just two minutes he is transformed into an extra snuggly and warm bushbaby to soothe, relax and comfort. He is cream and grey in colour with large beady blue eyes, a button nose and a long grey and blue stripy tail to help him balance. He is filled with treated millet and gently scented with lavender. YooHoo and Friends aim to spread the message to children about precious and endangered animals.&nbsp; YooHoo conforms to British safety standards and comes with his own instructions.&nbsp;</p>

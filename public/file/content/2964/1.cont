	A fantastic selection of six essential oils predominantly used in the winter months with wonderful warming properties. Used for inhalation or in blends for chills, colds or flu etc, the oils come delivered in a wonderful wooden storage box and make a lovely gift. Each winter essential oil gift box contains a 10ml bottle each of black pepper, camphor, cinnamon, eucalyptus, ginger and wintergreen plus the wooden storage box. If purchased separately this set would cost &pound;33.43 - our winter warmer offer is all these oils and the box for only &pound;19.99! This offer is available for a limited time only.&nbsp;The description and image for each gift set is accurate when added to our web site but should any item be out of stock we may replace this with a similar item and the boxes can switch between the 2 images as they can be hard to get hold of and this will mean there&#39;s no delay delivery but we would only do this with an item of the same or higher value.<br />

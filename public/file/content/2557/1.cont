	This brilliant octopus shaped massager is effective on the back, neck, shoulders, legs, arms and even on the head. This purple octopus has eight legs and does not require any power as it is manual and easily travels in a small pocket of a bag. It can be fun to use because of its shape, but it works effectively in easing the stress and strains of the hard working day. With it being plastic it is water proof and can be used whilst in bath or just in front of the telly, or when travelling etc. This brilliant massager does not require any massage oil but for better solutions why not try one of our relaxing or soothing massage oils? The octopus is approx. 11cm wide.</p>

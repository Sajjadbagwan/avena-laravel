	This natural shaving oil is designed as a wonderful alternative to expensive, commercial shaving foams and gels. It is blended with oils reputed to moisturise and protect sensitive skin while eliminating razor burn. It was originally made as a shaving oil for gents to use as pre-electric shaving skin treatment, to apply before shaving with a razor or as a post shave moisturiser, but we have sold so many to ladies for moisturising legs and under arms before or after shaving we now call it a unisex shaving oil.</p>

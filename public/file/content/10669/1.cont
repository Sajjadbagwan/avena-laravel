	This set of three cactus jars includes three very realistic cactus plants; one that looks more like an exotic flower, one wide and fat with a little one by its side and one with a lot of thinner cactuses together. This set of cactus jars is made with a lot of attention to detail from the tiny white pebbles, through the string bows to the needles of the cactuses. This lovely set would make the perfect addition to any household kept as a group or dotted around in the living room, bathroom, kitchen and hallway or even in the bedroom. This set would make a fantastic decoration placed anywhere in the home, on the windowsill, mantelpiece, shelf or table. The jars measure H7cm x W5cm each with the cactuses measuring approximately: H10.5cm, H6cm and H3.5cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

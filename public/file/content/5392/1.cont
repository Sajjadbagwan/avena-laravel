	Take a trip back through time and bathe as Cleopatra did. A fragrance based on a famous combination of oils, and pure jasmine and rose essential oils, along with a generous splash of coconut oil. A woody, floral fragrance opening with lemon and orange, followed by a bouquet of jasmine, gardenia, rose and lavender on a base of patchouli, sandalwood and musk. Your whoopie blaster can be used up to four times, simply place the whoopie blaster in warm water and watch as it fizzes rapidly releasing its fragrance and essential oils. Then take it out and save the rest for later. Please rinse petals or decorations away from the bath immediately after use to prevent accidental staining.

	This stunning looking skull has so much character about it with its cracks and holes, hollow features and even a missing tooth. This skull just gets better as it finished with three snakes crawling in and out through the skull, one of which is positioned in the middle with its mouth open, showing its sharp teeth as though it was threatening and ready to attack. The attention to detail and quality shows in the whole of this fantastic piece. This cool skull ornament is made of quality resin and would make the perfect addition to an existing skull collection or as a gift to someone who is a lover of these creepy but decorative pieces. The skull measures approximately 11cm tall and 14cm x 9cm wide and comes packaged in polystyrene and a white card box for safe shipping.</p>

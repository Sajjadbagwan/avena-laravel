	This verdigris Mozart chime is made from genuine hardwood with a cherry ash wood and weather resistant finish. It has heavy duty nylon string, whilst the tubes are a special powder coated aluminium alloy that will not rust and come with a one-year warranty. This fantastic Mozart chime comes carefully packed in a decorative box making it safe for shipping as well as an ideal gift. This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance. It is hand-tuned to a universal, pentatonic (five-note) scale and acts in concert with the wind to create random patterns of wonderful sound. This wonderful chime hangs at approximately 63.5cm long. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) lived a short but extremely rich musical life. Revered for numerous symphonies, chamber works, concerti and operas, his career started as a child prodigy and ended tragically at the young age of 35. This windchime pays tribute to his 250th birthday and is tuned to the opening intervals of the andante movement from his Piano Concerto No. 21 in C Major (K. 467).</p>

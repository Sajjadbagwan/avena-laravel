	This howlite heart is a wonderful deep blue colour and is said to eliminate rage and calm violent, uncontrolled anger. It is also believed to be good for teeth and bones. Crystals or healing gemstones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your wellbeing. Does it work? Have them in your house or place one near your bed to find out. All our hearts are fantastic quality, rich in colour, smooth and polished. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

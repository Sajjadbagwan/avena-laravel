	According to Thai folk wisdom, the intensely citrus aromas of lemongrass and kaffir lime help to relax and revitalise the senses. So we added their essential oils to our nourishing hand wash because we believe it&#39;s good to always be as calm as possible &ndash; and clean, soft, fragrant hands help. Apply to damp hands; inhale the calming aroma while lightly rubbing. Rinse off. This luxurious hand wash is formulated without parabens, propylene glycol, petroleum derivative, silicone, synthetic colours and fragrances&nbsp;or animal ingredients.</p>

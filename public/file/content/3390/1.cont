This super extra large alien figure has been expertly made by welding everyday metal objects together such as nails, screws, washers, bolts, lengths of metal, small pieces of sheet metal and more. The whole thing has then been electroplated which is an electrochemical process that deposits a thin layer of metal onto a metal base to create a glossy metallic finish that looks great! (This item is not recommended for young children due to small parts and some sharp edges). Each figure comes packaged in its own box and makes a novel gift idea. Dimensions: Height 30cms, Length 33cms, Width 24cms.

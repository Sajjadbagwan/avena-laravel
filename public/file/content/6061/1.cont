	These fantastic large stone faces make brilliant and novel garden ornaments. Designed to make you smile when you see them, their big lovable eyes and puffy cheeks have a comical and cheeky look about them, with their puckered lips maybe awaiting a kiss? They would bring a bit of cheer and humour to any part of the garden, patio, and windowsill or in a conservatory etc. These cute faces are made from quality resin with a white stone wash finish. They are also hollow so are not too heavy but can be filled with sand or similar to be weighed down if needed. They are suitable for indoors or outside however we don&rsquo;t recommend they are left out during severe frost. These&nbsp;large stone faces are approximately 17cm x 15cm wide and 15cm tall.</p>

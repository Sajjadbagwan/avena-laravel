	Virgo (22nd Aug - 22nd Sept) is earthy and represents the sixth sign of the zodiac. You belong to a group of people known for their perfectionism and highly analytical minds. There&#39;s a bit of a joke about how precise and demanding Virgos are but when you think about it, what&#39;s wrong with being tidy, organised and clean?&nbsp;The birthstone of Virgo is carnelian which is a wonderful deep red colour,&nbsp;thought to be&nbsp;a good balancer and it connects you with your inner self,&nbsp;lifting the emotions and giving courage. It is also said to benefit the kidneys, lungs and liver. This gorgeous heart pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their properties and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

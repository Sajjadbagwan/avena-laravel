	Superb high quality exquisite angel figurine by the fine art sculptor&nbsp;Anne Stokes.&nbsp; This is a beautifully haunting gothic piece which is&nbsp;hand painted and made from a cold cast porcelain resin.&nbsp; &nbsp;The angel&nbsp;curves her own wings protectively around herself in a heart shape.&nbsp; The haunting face of the angel is movingly sad&nbsp;with tears rolling from her eyes as she looks in sad wonderment at the rose in her hand and the petals that have started to fall.&nbsp; In the gothic world the petals falling from the rose symbolise things passing.&nbsp; The angel is standing upon a traditional Celtic-style circular stone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approx height: 22cm.&nbsp; This beautiful figurine&nbsp;is presented&nbsp;in a deocrative box making this an ideal gift.&nbsp;</p>

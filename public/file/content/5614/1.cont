	This lovely sheep design magnet is from the ever popular &#39;The Whimsical World of&nbsp;Thomas Joseph&#39; range. Thomas Joseph Stephenson,&nbsp;from the Irish Carrick Fergus, on the shore of Belfast Lough&nbsp;is famous for painting many subjects including sheep, landscapes&nbsp;and&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;people. This lovely magnet is 9cm long and 6.5cm wide and comes in a cellophane bag which makes it the perfect gift or addition to an existing magnet&nbsp;collection,&nbsp;sheep collection or both.&nbsp; This amusing magnet shows a washing line with two soaked sheep hanging from it along with&nbsp;other clothes. They are&nbsp;surrounded by other farm animals and a country house&nbsp;with the quote &lsquo;Hand Wash Only&rsquo;. The ideal gift for anyone having one of those days or where they may feel they have &lsquo;been hung out to dry&rsquo;.</p>

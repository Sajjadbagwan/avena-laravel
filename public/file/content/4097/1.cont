He is made from solid resin and finished in a weathered green effect with fantastic detail throughout, from the cheeky grin to the fine detail on the leaves surrounding the face. There is a metal keyhole type slot to the rear for fastening him to a door or wall. Measuring approx 17cm tall he is packed in a polystyrene block and in his own box for safe delivery and would make a quirky gift or a perfect housewarming gift idea.</span></span></p>

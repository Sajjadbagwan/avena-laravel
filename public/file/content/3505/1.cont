	This Ashleigh &amp; Burwood reed diffuser is a great natural way to fill your home with a scent you love. For those who don&#39;t like burning incense or prefer to be more eco-friendly than using plug-in room fresheners, a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting &amp; stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. With normal use, the liquid will last up to 4 months! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and let the reeds draw up the aromatic fragrance, gradually releasing the scent into the surrounding area. The geranium and grapefruit reed diffuser has a wonderful scent that is both relaxing and refreshing creating a positive and uplifting environment.</p>

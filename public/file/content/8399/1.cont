	This eye-catching tarot box is made of composite wood, covered in fabric and lined with a velvet effect material with a velvet underside. The art work shown on this charming box is a design by Lisa Parker. The moon gazing hare is sitting in a field of blue flowers looking at the sky, while the full moon is shining between the stars, illuminating the whole scene. Celtic design decorates the side of this fantastic box. The black velvet on the inside of the box makes it a fantastic accessory to store your tarot cards to keep them away from negative vibes. This lovely hare tarot box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who practices tarot or perhaps a lover of hares and would also make a great addition to an existing Lisa Parker collection. The box measures 14cm tall and 10cm x 6cm wide and comes in a decorative card box. &copy; Please do not copy text- Avena product description- Moon Gazing Tarot Box.</p>

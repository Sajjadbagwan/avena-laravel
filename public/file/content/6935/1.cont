	This lovely deck of tarot cards was created by the artist Elisabetta Trevisan who illustrates delicate forms, emotions and mystical messages through the pure beauty of crystals in the fragile outline of a stained-glass window. This mystical tarot deck contains both poetic and existential messages and touching these crystalline figures allows us to enter a world of pure beauty and love. This fantastic deck of tarot cards comes with divinatory instructions and features 78 cards &ndash; 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana cards -&nbsp;in the size of 64mm x 122mm.</p>

	On the front of this cute brown dancing owl there is a solar panel which powers the dancing motion. His wings move up and down as his hips sway from side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get him dancing, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not made as toys and are not suitable for children under 36 months&nbsp;of age&nbsp;due to small parts. Each owl comes in a clear cellophane bubble display. He is 10cm tall x 6cm wide.</p>

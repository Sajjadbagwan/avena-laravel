	Shampoo base is ideal for you to experiment with and create your own luxury shampoo products.

Tip: shampoo base can have quite a thick consistency making it hard to pour or blend oils with, heating for a short period in a suitable container in the microwave will make it a lot more manageable. Note: only ever add oils you are sure are safe to use in the bath and to the correct dilution.

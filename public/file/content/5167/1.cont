	This box of assorted fossils is crammed full of interesting specimens such as brachiopods, shark teeth, trilobites and crinoids, they are a great introduction to the world of fossils and the start of a collection. This box is suitable for a gift or simply to treat yourself. The box measures 7.5cms long, 5cms wide and 3cms deep. It is very popular with kids in our shop and is a great educational gift but does contain small parts and isn&rsquo;t suitable for very young children.</p>

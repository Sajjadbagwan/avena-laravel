	Tree Man oil burner with brilliant detail made from quality resin and finished in a very realistic tree bark effect. The eyes of the Tree Man are made from a pearlescent green glass which illuminate when the candle is lit and looks great if not a bit spooky. The glass oil dish sits at the top held by protruding branches under which is a well for the tea light to sit. The Tree Man burner is one of our best selling oil burners. He sits 18cm tall so is a good size and is well packaged in his own box making a super gift idea. The detail of the face with his large eyebrows, nose and beard is really wonderful and when you look closer you then see small leaves and mushrooms dotted around the whole piece. For burning oils, granules and tea light candles see bottom of this page.</p>

	Jim&nbsp;the scarecrow would make a novelty and fun addition to any garden, patio, greenhouse, planter etc. At approximately 95cm tall this type of scarecrow is the biggest we sell and would stand out well in any garden but they are&nbsp;also quite lightweight and not too top heavy for display in medium to larger plant pots and planters.&nbsp;Jim is a very cheeky looking scarecrow with a big smile and&nbsp;rosy cheeks and&nbsp;he&#39;s wearing blue denim dungarees with a bright checked shirt, cute neckerchief and fun hat.&nbsp;These scarecrows have straw hands and feet and come attached to a bamboo cane ready to place in and around the garden; they are very popular with adults and children alike. The garden scarecrows are very well made and suitable for indoor and outdoor use but due to the nature of the product we would not recommend leaving it out in bad weather.</p>

	A fantastic selection in colours of our wonderful large glass shells which come delivered by the kilo bag with approx 25 shells per bag. These shells are ideal for many purposes including mosaics, fish tanks, floral decorations in vases and many arts and craft uses. They are a particularly great seller in our Skipton shop and children especially love to collect them. Each shell is approx 45mm in diameter.</p>

	These fantastic looking colourful cat&#39;s eye rune stones are of excellent quality and come in a zip pouch with an information card. Traditionally, cat&#39;s eye is believed to protect the wearer from evil spirits. Cat&#39;s eye dispels unwanted energy from the aura. It amplifies good luck and fortune. Runes are thought by some to be a way of interacting with both the spirit and the living world. The system of premonition by runes can be credited to two tribes who came together and produced a combination of symbols and old signs which were found on a variety of paintings, ritual and domestic items in the North from as early as Paleolithic times. There are, however, other myths surrounding the origins of the runes including the Volsungr, a Northern ancestral tribe who crossed into Europe before the Ice Age. Today the use of the runes seems to be enjoying a modern day revival with collections becoming widely available. They are great to collect or to give as a gift. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	A decorative natural wood dream catcher which has three hoops which have the natural web design of a dream catcher, and features a pale red bead in the centre of the web. Decorated with beads and a variety of feathers this is a traditional looking dream catcher. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams or important messages through.</p>

The wolf inside is hollow and sits on a dark grey plate that when removed, can have an incense cone placed on it, and when the wolf is placed back on, the smoke from the incense rises up out of the wolf&rsquo;s mouth, allowing for a beautiful array of smoke to dance around of the jaws of this majestic beast. This decorative cone burner can be placed anywhere, a windowsill, on a mantlepiece or on a side table. This wolf cone burner would also make the ideal gift for all the wolf lovers of the world. This stunning wolf measures H12cm x W7cm at the base and comes in a decorative gift box. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Wolf Incense Cone Burner.</p>

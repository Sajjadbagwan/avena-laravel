<p>This Buddha carries a money sack on his back which is to protect your wealth and the Buddha also carries a calabash for good health. The Buddhas'' belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity. By stroking it, it is believed to bring much luck and fortune. Always place your Buddha in a position of honour and respect but never on the floor. They can be placed in any part of your home, but never in the bathroom or toilet. The laughing red buddha is approx 5cm tall.</p>

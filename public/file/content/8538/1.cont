	This quality candle in a tin was made using pure lavandin oil, which is an extract of a hybrid plant that originates from lavender. Lavandin is great for keeping insects away which makes this candle the perfect companion when in the garden, camping, having a barbeque or a weekend away by the lake etc. This luxurious candle was blended with fresh Provencal herbs - Herbes de Provence is a fragrant mixture of dried herbs typical of southern French cooking. Exact recipes vary, but thyme, savory, rosemary and an aniseed-scented herb such as fennel or tarragon are typical ingredients. This fantastic candle has an approximate 8 hours burning time and the silver tin measures 4cm tall and 10cm in diameter. Price&rsquo;s candles have been around for 170 years and have a long and close association with the Royal Family.

They claim that candles are not just sources of natural light but are aesthetic, fragranced and highly designed objects in their own right.&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 19.5px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(52, 45, 39);">&copy; Please do not copy text.

	Worry stones or thumb stones are excellent for relieving stress and helping you concentrate while problem solving, studying, revising or meditating. Rub the smooth, highly polished stone gently in the palm of your hand or with your thumb every time you feel the need and it will absorb the stress from your body while your worries seem to melt away. Faced with a stressful situation, rubbing the stone is said to transfer energies from the stone which also absorbs the negativity associated with stress. Our velvet pouch contains five heart shaped worry stones that you can keep together and alternate the use or give away as individual gifts. Please note as the stones are natural the colour will vary. We may also use a different colour pouch should we sell out of purple.</p>

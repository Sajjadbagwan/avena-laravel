	This fascinating embossed journal contains blank pages of acid free, sustainable forest paper. The art work of Anne Stokes illustrates a gothic fairy kneeling next to a pool of water. She reaches out with her hand to touch to pool but in the waters reflection is a skull staring back. This gorgeous embossed journal of the Dark Fairy and the owl would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of fairies, skeletons or any kind of creatures created by our fantasies. This designer journal is 17.5cm long and 12.5cm x 1.5cm wide and comes packaged in cellophane.&nbsp;</p>

	This charming little sheep shelf sitter (don&rsquo;t say it too fast!) has a black, resin body, head and hooves with a white fluffy coat and cute face. This little sheep will sit flat or with its legs hanging over the edge of the shelf, fireplace or windowsill. This cute sitting sheep would make a cheerful decoration anywhere in the house or conservatory or would make a lovely gift idea for someone who is a lover of these cute and fluffy little creatures and would be the perfect addition to an existing sheep collection. It is approximately 12cm tall including the legs.&nbsp;</p>

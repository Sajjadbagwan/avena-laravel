	These CDs are the perfect toolkit to pursue and assist a chosen therapy, energy or pastime. The music has been crafted to produce an ambience that allows the mind freedom for healing, visualisation and relaxation with consistent mood and texture. This wonderful CD has a selection of music ideally suited to aromatherapy, reflexology or just plain and simple massage. The art of aromatherapy harnesses the potent, pure essences of aromatic plants, flowers and resins and uses them to restore the harmony between body and mind. This album has been compiled by Medwin Goodall in close collaboration with various alternative therapists. An essential tool for both the professional therapist and the absolute beginner.&nbsp;</p>

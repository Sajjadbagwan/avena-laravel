	This lovely butterfly ash catcher is made from sheesham wood, a hard rosewood indigenous to India and the wood for this item comes from renewable forest plantations. Each incense holder is handmade in India and has been finished with wonderful inlayed brass details. It is then waxed to bring out the natural colour and finish of the wood. The four brass holes firmly grip the incense sticks upright when burning which simply allows the ash to&nbsp;fall onto the dish, keeping your furniture clean and ash free. These brass holes are surrounded by gold stars and in the centre there is the pattern of a gold butterfly. This charming incense holder allows you to burn up to four incense sticks and a cone at the same time, to create your own favourite individual aroma and it would make a beautiful gift especially when accompanied with Avena incense sticks. This incense holder is approximately 7cm in diameter.</p>

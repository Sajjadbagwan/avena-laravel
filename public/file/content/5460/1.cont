	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This fantastic looking dried fruit circle is a modern and unique take on the traditional Christmas wreath. It has been made with whole limes, orange slices, whole chillies, apple slices and cinnamon sticks. It is finished with a raffia hanger and scented with a Christmas scent. The decoration will nicely feature on a door or wall and measures approximately 25cm in diameter.</span></p>

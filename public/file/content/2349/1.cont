	This Lavender Churn Candle is delicately fragranced with the finest English Lavender. At 18cm it is a solid pillar candle, burning very well; it is truly a great quality. Having more of this candle on i.e. the top of the fireplace would make a superb decoration. This lovely candle has a deep lilac colour accompanied with a similar coloured little bow. Lavender is famed for its relaxing properties and one of the most easily recognised floral aromas. Unfairly clich&eacute;d, Lavender forms the base of many of the world&rsquo;s most famous and enduring fine fragrances. Lit in any room it would set the mood for the evening with its flicker light and the delicious scent of lavender surrounding the area. Would make a lovely gift idea pared up with any other lavender products from our range!</p>

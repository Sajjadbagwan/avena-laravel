	This eye-catching tarot box is made of composite wood, covered in fabric and lined with a velvet effect material with a velvet underside. The art work shown on this charming box is a design by Lisa Parker. The brown owl is resting on a road sign pointing to Pendle to guide us to the way of the witch who lives deep in the woods. The sides of this fantastic box are decorated with a Celtic design. The black velvet on the inside of the box makes it a fantastic accessory to store your tarot cards to keep them away from negative vibes. This lovely owl tarot box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who practices tarot or who is perhaps a lover of owls and would also make a great addition to an existing Lisa Parker collection. The box measures 14cm tall and 10cm x 6cm wide and comes in a decorative card box. &copy; Please do not copy text- Avena product description- Tarot Box Way of the Witch.</p>

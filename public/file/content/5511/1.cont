	This fantastic looking mystical paperweight is made from crystal and is designed by Lisa Parker. It is one of her most popular illustrations of the owl spell keeper. The owl is sitting on a crystal ball with a pentagram. The night sky and leafless branches are showing through the window behind the owl creating an airy and mystical image. This stunning paperweight comes presented in its own gift box making it a lovely gift for someone who likes owls or who is a Lisa Parker fan/collector. The paperweight measures 7.5cm in diameter and the gift box measures 9cm wide and 4.5cm tall.<br />

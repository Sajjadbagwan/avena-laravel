	This eye-catching mirror box is made of composite wood, covered in fabric and lined with a velvet effect material with a velvet underside. The art work shown on this charming box is a design by Lisa Parker. The moon gazing hare is sitting in a field of blue flowers looking at the sky, while the full moon is shining between the stars, illuminating the whole scene. Celtic design and dancing hares decorate the side of this fantastic box. The 7cm x 7cm wide mirror and the black velvet cover on the inside of the box make it a fantastic accessory to store jewellery, hair accessories or make-up etc. This lovely hare mirror box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who loves pretty accessories or would make the perfect addition to an existing Lisa Parker collection. The box measures 10cm x 10cm wide and comes in a decorative card box.</p>

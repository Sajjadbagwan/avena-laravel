	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This owl quotation pebble shows a cute but wise owl promising the words &lsquo;Owl Be There for You&rsquo;. The wise owl is sitting on a bench which is charmingly decorated with green leaves. His message is etched into the pebble making the perfect gift for a friend or sibling on any occasion or no occasion at all, just to say thank you or show your friendship! The pebbles fit perfectly into our small drawstring gift bags to make them extra special as a gift and so can be sent to someone on their own, inside a greetings card or as an addition to a larger gift. They are also small enough to be carried&nbsp;in a pocket or handbag&nbsp;for luck or as a reminder to keep the quotation in mind. We have many other quotes and animals in this pebble range including dogs, cats, squirrels and foxes meaning they are also becoming quite collectable. The resin pebbles measure 35mm by 25mm and are great quality. They really are the ideal little gift and make everyone who reads them smile so why not spread some happiness and wise words today and send one to someone you care about?</span></p>

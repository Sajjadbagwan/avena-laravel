	This lovely yet spooky wooden plaque is ideal for Halloween decoration showing a haunted house and silhouettes of leafless trees all under a full moon with the words &lsquo;BEWARE! A witch lives here with her little monsters&rsquo;. Complete with a wire hanger it can be hung anywhere around the house but this one is especially popular as a door welcome sign or hung facing out of a window as the perfect way to welcome party guests or kids on their trick or treat rounds. This Halloween wooden hanger measures 12cm tall and 12cm wide.</p>

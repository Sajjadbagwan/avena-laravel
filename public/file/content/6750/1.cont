	Cancer (21st June - 20th July), the fourth sign of the zodiac, is a water sign, which signifies your highly emotional nature. Being under the sway of the element of water also makes you highly caring, generous and intuitive. You are highly evolved, even spiritual - the water signs are karmically developed and refined in spirit. The birthstone of Cancer is opalite which is an all-round healing stone and is believed to stabilise mood swings and purify the blood and kidneys. It is also said that this stone maintains constancy and serenity. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their properties and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece. Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

	Pumice stones are often used in beauty salons during pedicure process to remove dry and excess skin from the bottom of the foot. Pumice is created when super-heated, highly pressurized rock is violently ejected from a&nbsp;volcano. The unusual foamy configuration of pumice happens because of simultaneous rapid cooling and rapid depressurization. This neat, foot shaped pumice stone is the perfect item to add to bath gift sets or hampers, comes in shrink wrapped packaging and is approximately 10cm x 6cm at the widest points.</p>

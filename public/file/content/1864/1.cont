	This superb high quality hypnotherapy CD by the UK&#39;s best selling hypnotherapist Glenn Harrold, combines powerful clinical hypnotherapy techniques with state of the art digital recording technology. There are two hypnotherapy sessions on the CD. Track one is a 30 minute hypnotherapy track that will help you build a powerful desire to exercise regularly by associating feelings of great pleasure and enjoyment with exercise and fitness. Track two is a 15 minute hypnosis affirmation track that can be used as a booster. On the CD you will hear a pleasant English voice and 60 B.P.M sound effects guiding you into a deep state of mental and physical relaxation. In this very receptive relaxed state you are given a number of post hypnotic and direct suggestions to help you to become more active in your daily life. There are also a number of background echoed affirmations, which pan from left to right in your headphones. This deeply relaxing and powerful method of delivering multiple suggestions simultaneously to the unconscious mind can facilitate positive changes very quickly. At the end of the recording you will be gently brought back to full waking consciousness with a combination of suggestion and music. There are also a number of positive subliminal suggestions (listed inside) which are embedded in the fade out music and facilitate the overall effect. This powerful CD is a completely safe and very effective way of helping you to create a powerful desire to become fit through regular exercise.</p>

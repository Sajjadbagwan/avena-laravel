	Just as everybody likes to have a long, warm bath after a long and stressful day, each of us will have our own recipe for the perfect bathing experience. Have you ever considered enhancing your bath by using essential oils?<br />
	<br />
	Essential oils come in many different forms, each with a distinct effect. For example, there is <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/search-results/?S=benzoin">benzoin essential oil</a>, which gives energy and so is useful if you are hoping for a bath which will wake you up a little. <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/search-results/?S=cardamom">Organic cardamom essential oil</a>, meanwhile, is noted for its aphrodisiac properties, and <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/search-results/?S=ginger">ginger essential oil</a> has warming properties that will be just the ticket on a cold night.<br />
	<br />
	Certain oils can be used to help relieve symptoms during an illness. Give <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/search-results/?S=cinnamon%20essential%20oil">cinnamon essential oil</a> a try if you are suffering from a cold or flu, or put <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/search-results/?S=eucalyptus%20pure%20essential%20oil">eucalyptus pure essential oil</a> into your bath to relieve muscle aches or arthritis.<br />
	<br />
	There are also various oils which have the straightforward and welcome effect of soothing their user - such as <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/search-results/?S=German%20chamomile%20oil">German chamomile oil</a>, or <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/search-results/?S=clary%20sage%20essential%20oil">clary sage essential oil</a> if you prefer an oil which doubles as a perfume. These will make the perfect choice if you have been through a hard day&#39;s work and just need something to help you unwind and relax.<br />

	This highly polished angel ornament is handcrafted from Turquoise Howlite and stands on its own.<br />
	This fantastic angel would make the perfect addition to any room of the home or would make the perfect gift idea for someone special as a small gesture to lift faith or for protection etc.<br />
	Howlite is said to help control strong emotions and restore a sense of calm to the mind and body. It is also believed to heighten creativity so is a great gift for anyone creative, learning or seeking inspiration.<br />
	This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.<br />
	This wonderful carved angel measures H3cm x W1cm x L2cm, a handy pocket size so you can carry it with you anywhere you go.&nbsp;</p>

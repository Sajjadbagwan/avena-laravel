	This beautiful collection of minerals comes in a great presentation box containing information cards for each mineral. This fantastic collection is the perfect way to inspire interest in the earth&rsquo;s geology. Each set contains a selection of six mineral pieces, which are pyrite, rose quartz, citrine, amethyst, quartz geode and an agate slice. Minerals make up the rocks that form the Earth&rsquo;s crust. The atoms within the minerals are arranged in an orderly way, meaning that many of them form attractive crystals and gemstones, which are known for their shine, colour and rarity and are often used in jewellery. Minerals also vary in strength, such as diamonds, which are extremely strong and can easily scratch glass to others like talc which are soft and crumbly. Although very popular with kids and a great educational gift these products are not toys and are therefore&nbsp;not suitable for children under 36 months as they may contain small parts and sharp edges.&nbsp;</p>

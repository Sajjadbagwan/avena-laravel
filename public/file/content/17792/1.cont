	This stunning chime harnesses the soothing tones of bamboo, tuned to create an ambient melody as the wind catches it in it&#39;s breeze. This chime has a segment of coconut shell, with six different length of hollowed out and tuned bamboo branches, all-together to make this beautiful sounding chime. The chimes are decorated with a yin and yang pattern that has been painted on using beautiful colours to contrast the neutrality of the bamboo its self, adding to it&#39;s charm. Usually hung in gardens where the wind can play it&#39;s enchanting tune, this chime can be hung anywhere from bedrooms, to kitchens, to living rooms. It would make a wonderful gift for someone who is a lover of natural and Asian inspired decoration. Measuring at H102cm from the hook at the top, to the bottom of the wind catcher. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Yin Yang Bamboo Wind Chime</p>

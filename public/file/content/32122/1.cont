	A beautiful mirrored sun motif on a cascade of crystals with complementary beads is finished with a 38mm Swarovski&reg; spectra almond rainbow maker crystal.<br />
	On a good quality silver metal chain every crystal has a hangtag with an individual description and sentiment relevant to each design.<br />
	This piece measures 24cm from the top hook to the bottom of the crystal. The actual Swarovski&reg; rainbow maker crystal measures 3.5cm x 2cm so is a very generous size and hung in a sunlit window will make the most beautiful and mesmerising dancing rainbow display although they are so lovely they can be hung anywhere and make ideal gifts for many occasions such as Christenings, Mothers&#39; Day, house warming, birthdays, Valentine&#39;s etc.<br />
	Designed and handmade in the UK they really are a beautiful and heart-warming gift</p>

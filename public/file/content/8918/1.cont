	This one-hoop traditional dream catcher is made with brown coloured materials decorated with brown and white wooden beads and also brown feathers finished with a silver clip making it ideal to place on a bunch of keys, zips, bags or even clothing. This fantastic dream catcher keyring measures approximately 20cm long and the actual hoop measures 5cm in diameter. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Keyring Dream Catcher.</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px">This unique looking owl wind bell would make a fantastic addition to any place inside&nbsp;the house or out. The hanger is made from metal with a silver finish. The owl is lovely and round with large glittery gold beady eyes and gold spots on its chest. It is sitting on a perch looking very sweet and wise. The hanger has a few large plastic gems on the string with a metal branch in the middle, separating them. At the base of the hanger is the silver heart bell that makes a lovely deep sound when&nbsp;caught by the&nbsp;breeze. The owl wind bell hangs at 60cm long.</span></p>

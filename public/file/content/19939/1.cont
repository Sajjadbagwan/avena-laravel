	The calendula flowers contain a variety of compounds which are believed to support wound healing with anti-inflammatory properties, constricting blood vessels to stop bleeding and draw out infections, which is why calendula was often used during the American Civil War.</p>

	Our infused calendula is a lovely golden orange oil and is now more known for its soothing properties in skin care. Therapists often use this oil on such conditions as eczema, nappy rash, dry skin, abrasions, acne, stretch marks, sore or cracked nipples and even burns. It is also now very often used to treat thread and spider veins as well as varicose veins.</p>

	Herbalists still believe that calendula oil is very versatile, speeding the healing of wounds, making the skin more supple by increasing blood supply to it as well as soothing pain when used topically. Calendula is also known as pot marigold or Calendula officinalis; a fantastic oil for massage blended together with other carrier oils, essential oils or directly on skin conditions.</p>

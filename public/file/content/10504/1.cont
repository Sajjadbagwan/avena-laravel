	This richly scented fragrance oil is filled with a special long lasting fragrance, blended together with delicious wild red berries and spicy cinnamon and topped with warm citrus fruits and subtle spices to infuse your home. This wonderful bottle of fragrance oil smells and looks good and it is the perfect addition to Christmas stockings or as part of a hamper and is ideal for use in oil burners, lamp rings, to drop onto potpourri or dried fruit to refresh a fading aroma. To use in oil burners fill the dish/well with water and add a few drops of oil; due to the quality of our oils 5-10 drops should suffice but you can add more for a stronger aroma. This Cinnamon Creek fragrance oil contains 10ml of the blend. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Cinnamon Creek Reviver Oil 10ml.</p>

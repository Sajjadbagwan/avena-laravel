	Apricot kernel oil originates from northern China, the Himalaya region and northern India. It is rich in essential fatty acids, oleic and linoleic acid, and is known for its ability to penetrate the skin without leaving an oily feel. Apricot kernel also has moisturising and revitalising properties which makes it popular in products for dehydrated, delicate, aging, sensitive or inflamed skin.</p>
<p>
	Apricot is a relative of the almond and peach, the apricot tree is now native to Spain and cultivated in the Mediterranean and California. It bears soft cream blossoms with pink-yellow centres. It is used in soothing creams and massage oils, especially those for the face or to help soothe inflammation and can calm skin irritations. The fact that apricot kernel is high in poly-unsaturated fatty acids makes it especially beneficial when used in facial massage and it is a wonderful all round carrier oil. It can be used on its own, directly on the skin or blended with other carrier oils.</p>

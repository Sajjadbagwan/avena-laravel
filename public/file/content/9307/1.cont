	This stunning traditional blue and white dream catcher is made up of five hoops and is decorated with multi-coloured string, brown and white feathers and black beads. This fantastic dream catcher would make the perfect addition to any household placed above a bed to make use of its function but would make a fantastic decoration hung on the wall or in the window. This five hoop large dream catcher measures approximately 60cm from the top loop to the bottom feather. The biggest hoop is 27cm, the medium hoops are 9cm and the smallest hoop is 7cm in diameter. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Blue Dream Catcher Large.</p>

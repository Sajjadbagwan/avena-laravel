	This eye-catching tarot box is made of composite wood, covered in fabric and lined with a velvet effect material with a velvet underside. The art work shown on this eye-catching box is a design by Anne Stokes, showing a black cat in a sitting position with one paw resting on the ouija board; celtic design surrounds this wonderful image. The black velvet on the inside of the box makes it a fantastic accessory to store your tarot cards to keep them away from negative vibes. This lovely cat tarot box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who practices tarot or who is perhaps a lover of cats and would also make a great addition to an existing Anne Stokes collection. The box measures 14cm tall and 10cm x 6cm wide and comes in a decorative card box. &copy; Please do not copy text - Avena product description - Angel Spirit Guide Tarot Box.</p>

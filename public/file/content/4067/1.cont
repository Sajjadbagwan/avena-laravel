	Greta the gargoyle has been formed in a detailed grotesque design finished black and grey colours. This fantastic creature is sitting down by putting his weight on his legs. He is holding two fingers up to look through between them with his realistic yellow and red eyes. He has his wings sticking up to the air with spikes running through on his back between them. He is probably telling someone that he is keeping an eye out on him! He has light long nails and a tail which is curled up behind him. Greta makes a fantastic ornament in a garden next to a plant pot as well as put in the house or conservatory by the fireplace or towards a collection. He is made of solid resin and is packed in a polystyrene tube for safe transit, put in a brown box. This ornament is heavier than it looks and is approx. 18cm wide, 23cm long and 19cm tall and would make the perfect gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures. &nbsp;</p>

	Large Winchester glass bottles are used for transporting bulk oils or more commonly for the storage of essential oils or blended oils. They come with a black plastic screw-on poly cone cap (they seal with a hygienic and long lasting plastic cone insert as opposed to the old style card discs). The amber glass protects the contents from light damage and keeps the contents fresh while prolonging the shelf life. Amber glass bottles are ideal for pure essential oils, fragrance oils, bath oils, nail oils, beauty products, massage oils or any mix containing essential oils. Height 243mm. Base diameter 85mm. Contents 1000ml/1ltr.</p>

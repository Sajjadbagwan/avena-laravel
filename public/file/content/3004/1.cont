	A large piece of natural amethyst which has been made into a tea light candle holder. A totally natural product and a beautiful stone which, when the tea light is lit, shimmers and glistens and emits a stunning glow. As this is a 100% natural product the size and shape of each candle holder varies, however the approximate size is 13cm x 11cm x 6cm. This is a natural rough stone product that is not cut to any exact dimensions, meaning the shape and size of the item can vary slightly from the picture shown as could the colour, shade and/or pattern where applicable. We always choose the best quality stone products from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.

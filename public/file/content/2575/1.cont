	A beautiful onyx tealight holder in the shape of a crescent moon. The wonderful green and brown swirly patterns in onyx vary in each piece making each individual. Each candle holder is highly polished, solid onyx and is smooth and cool to the touch. Quite a large piece this measures approx 12cm from point to point and 6cm&nbsp;across the middle. Each is supplied snug in a gift box just the right size and makes an ideal gift.</p>

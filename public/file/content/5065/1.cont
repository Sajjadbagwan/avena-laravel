	Rose quartz is known as the &lsquo;love stone&rsquo;. It is said to aid peacefulness and calm in relationships and is also said to ease stress and tension whilst assisting sleep. This heart is the smaller size measuring approximately 2cm wide. Gemstone hearts are cut and highly polished natural semi-precious stones and come in a wide range of shapes and varieties of stone. Each has their own unique properties and are ideal to use as a worry stone, keeping in your hand, pocket or bag wherever you go. They can be placed under your pillow at night, used for meditation or chakra healing, simply as a way to collect some wonderful semi-precious stones or as an ideal gift idea they fit perfectly into our mini drawstring pouch. Price is per single heart. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

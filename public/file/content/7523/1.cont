	Sarah the fairy is a wonderful piece designed in the highest quality, from the brilliant colours throughout down to the finest details such as her charming face, the leaf she is sitting on and the patterns of her wings. This beautiful looking fairy is wearing a brown top and a green skirt decorated with white and yellow petals at her waist completed with grey silver cuffs. Her blondish hair is in fantastic contrast to her brownish, beautifully decorated wings. Sarah is sitting on a detailed brown leaf with a little ladybug at her feet. This charming fairy would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of these butterfly-winged creatures or would make a lovely addition to an existing fairy collection. This fantastic work of art measures approximately 13cm tall and 10.5cm wide and comes packaged in polystyrene and a decorative card box for safe shipping.</p>

	These charming Large Sheep Shelf Sitters (don&rsquo;t say it too fast!) have a cream, resin body, head and boots with a white fluffy coat and cute face.</p>
<p>
	These little sheep will sit flat or with their legs hanging over the edge of the shelf, fireplace or windowsill. These cute sitting sheep would make a cheerful decoration anywhere in the house or conservatory or would make a lovely gift idea for someone who is a lover of these cute and fluffy little creatures and would be the perfect addition to an existing sheep collection.</p>
<p>
	These come as a pair.</p>
<p>
	They are approximately 19cm tall including the legs.&nbsp;</p>

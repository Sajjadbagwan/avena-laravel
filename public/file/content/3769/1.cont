	<span style="line-height: 17.77px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0,0,0); font-size: 12.22px">This is a beautifully stunning gift set complete with a handcrafted fragrance lamp utilising the century old catalytic combustion technique, and a&nbsp;bottle of fragrance oil. This stunning fragrance lamp is hand crafted and designed with a delicate mosaic finish that glistens&nbsp;under light in lovely shades of purple and blue. The design comes with a bronze snuffer cap and a brass effect decorative cap for when it&rsquo;s at work evaporating and sending out a delicious lavender aroma around the room. The fragrance oil comes in a decorated clear plastic bottle, with a well presented label on the front. The bottle is a 250ml bottle, the perfect size to get started as it should last approximately 10 hours. They are both presented together in a wonderful black gift box with golden calligraphy and designs on the lid and around the sides. The lamp itself is approximately 12cm tall, the box being approximately 15cm long and 10cm in width. To use the lamp simply place the fragranced lamp oil inside the fragrance lamp, insert the wick into the fragrance with the stone placed on top and leave to soak for around 20-30 minutes. Place the lamp on a heat resistant surface and light the stone. (Be aware that the flame may become quite high and the stone will get hot.) Leave the flame lit for around 2-3 minutes without any caps over it, and then simply blow the flame out. Place the decorative cap supplied over the stone as the lamp gets to work evaporating the fragrance. To stop it, simply take the decorative cap off, (be careful as it may be hot!!) and place the snuffer cap over the stone this will stop the fragrance from evaporating.</span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px">This stunning hanging sign is made from wood. Each letter is&nbsp;perfectly carved to create the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; and attached to a patchwork background. A thin piece of wood is attached underneath &lsquo;love&rsquo; with the words &lsquo;makes this house a home&rsquo; on it. The carved lettering is cream in colour with a stitching effect around the outside. Deep red carved hearts, buttons and swirly designs decorate the rest of the sign. It has a wire hanger so is easy to attach to walls, doors etc. around the house. It is an ideal decorative piece for any home and would make a great gift to give to friends, or as a house warming present. The sign measures 19cm x 14 cm including wire hanger.&nbsp;</span></p>

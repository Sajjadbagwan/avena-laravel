	Aromatic Skin Tonic is designed to help directly tackle oily or problem skin. It is widely used by people suffering from acne, spots, pimples or similar blemishes and is ideal for teenagers in search of healthier and clearer skin. It contains pure essential oils renowned to help produce a rich soothing treatment and works not only at the surface level but is also designed to relieve the root problems. This acne treatment contains juniper berry to help draw out impurities and also help purify the skin through deep penetrating cleansing. Ylang ylang then contributes toward skin health through its ancient properties as a powerful skin healer. Essential oils are particularly effective at providing a natural acne remedy through the fact that they work on surface skin blemishes and then penetrate deep into problem skin without clogging up pores. They can also stop a build up of dry skin and the anti-bacterial ingredients help to prevent new skin breakouts. We believe that this special blend of oils that we formulated over many years genuinely provides a glorious natural acne treatment for teenagers and adults alike. To use: shake well before use and apply to a dry cotton wool ball then gently massage over the face and neck, concentrating on particularly troublesome areas. Ideally, this natural acne treatment should be used in the morning and evening.</p>

	The word &#39;meditation&#39; often fills people with a sense of doubt. Many would say that they find it too hard to relax and clear their mind sufficiently. Doubt is one of the main reasons why a number of people begin to feel disenchanted with meditation, and because of that - they simply stop practicing it.</p>

	In truth, to meditate is so much simpler and uncomplicated than the general consensus would have you believe. There doesn&#39;t&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to be a sudden revelation of mind, or a miraculous jaunt to the astral plane. Simple clarity of the mind and spirit, alongside complete physical relaxation should always be considered as being a successful period of meditation. Of course, achieving a level of relaxation and a calm clear mind can freely be assisted by using certain &#39;tools of the trade&#39;.<br />
	<br />
	Aromas are a great way to calm and relax oneself during meditation. With a wide and diverse range of incense sticks and essential oils, you can find the one that works for you. Some are said to promote enlightenment or draw you closer to your inner divinity and some may simply bring back memories of a relaxing day spent lying on the grass in the summer sun. Whichever aroma you choose, the scent that surrounds you can help to focus the mind and achieve that elusive &#39;blank canvas&#39;.<br />
	<br />
	Precious stones and crystals are a very popular tool of meditation. With each stone said to have its own unique energies and qualities, you can choose to employ a wide range of gems to aid you with meditating on just about anything. The earthy nature of precious stones will certainly help to ground and relax you, simply keep whichever ones take your fancy close to yourself, or even hold one in your hand as a means of focus.<br />
	<br />
	Perhaps the simplest tools of all are the humble candle and music! Being beside a flickering flame is wonderfully relaxing and teamed up with a CD of relaxing sounds and instruments can provide absolute joy and relaxation. Surely that&#39;s the basic goal of anyone who meditates?</div>

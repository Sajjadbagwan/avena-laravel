	A stunning ceramic reed diffuser from Ashleigh &amp; Burwood. A superb high quality gift set presented in beautiful packaging. Contains a stylish ceramic vase for the fragrance oil, with 12 wood diffusers each with lavender flower cut outs and a 200ml plastic bottle of gorgeous and calming lavender diffuser oil. A truly wonderful gift for any home. For those who don&#39;t like burning incense or prefer to be more eco friendly than using plug-in room fresheners a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting &amp; stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. With normal use the liquid will last up to 4 months! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and sit back whilst the fragrance is absorbed through the stick and evaporates across your room.</p>

	A beautiful gold plated bee motif with a heart in the centre. The mirror-gold motif is set between a matching bead run and a crystal cascade in the autumn gold colourway, and captures sunlight to create colourful projections onto walls and surfaces. Completed with a brilliant clear crystal pendant for maximum rainbow-making effects.<br />
	This piece measures 20cm from the top hook to the bottom of the crystal.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;Designed and handmade in the UK they really are a beautiful and heart-warming gift.</p>

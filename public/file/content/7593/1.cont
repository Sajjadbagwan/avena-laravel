	This charming sheep quotation pebble shows a fluffy little sheep standing on green grass surrounded by flowers with the words &lsquo;friendsheep&rsquo; etched into the top half of the pebble. The pebbles fit perfectly into our small drawstring gift bags to make them extra special as a gift and so can be sent to someone on their own, inside a greetings card or as an addition to a larger gift. They are also small enough to be carried in a pocket or handbag for luck. We have many other quotes and animals in this pebble range including dogs, owls, squirrels and foxes meaning they are also becoming quite collectable. The resin pebbles measure 35mm by 25mm and are great quality. They really are the ideal little gift and make everyone who reads them smile so why not spread some happiness and wise words today and send one to someone you care about?</p>

	Goldstone is a beautiful amber colour with a wonderful glittery effect. It is associated with wealth and abundance, stimulates physical and spiritual energies, encourages poise and is also said to be the stone of growth.&nbsp;Goldstone is the birthstone of Leo (21st July - 21st Aug) and the symbol of prosperity. This gorgeous heart pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

	These decorative wooden garlands are the perfect accessory for Halloween as they can be hung anywhere around the house, on doors or in windows. Made from wood and strong string these are quality, sturdy decorations and not the lighter or cheaper type. We have two brilliant designs, pumpkins with bats and ghosts with cobwebs. The wooden figures are attached to an adjustable wire covered with ripped cloth adding to the effect. They have hooks for hanging and make the perfect Halloween decor. These festive garlands are approximately 70cm long but the size can be adjusted to a little longer or shorter to make the best fit in the space needed.</p>

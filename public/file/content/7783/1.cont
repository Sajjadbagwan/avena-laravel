	These charming Christmas figures are made of metal and all have wobbly legs which allow them to swing back and forth and side to side when stood up. All of these creatures have a wide smile on their faces, and their bodies look like fir trees. One of them is a snowman wearing a red hat, a green scarf and black boots with a white fir tree body holding a broom in one of his wire hands. Santa has a red fir tree body wearing green gloves and is holding a present in one hand and a miniature Christmas tree in the other. The reindeer has a green fir tree body and is wearing a red hat with matching scarf and boots; he is holding a wire with a present, a star and a miniature fir tree attached to it. All these charming figures would make a lovely addition to your Christmas decorations and would look good in a group or just standing alone on a shelf, mantelpiece or a windowsill in any room of the home during the festive season. These wonderful creatures measure approximately 13cm tall and 6cm wide each.</p>

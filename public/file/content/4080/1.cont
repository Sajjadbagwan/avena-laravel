	A lovely ceramic oil burner in a fantastic shade of blue that drifts into black in the middle of the bowl and towards the bottom of the base, creating a&nbsp;lovely colour effect . The burner is finished with a beautiful glaze and&nbsp;has the moon and star cut-outs that look fantastic with a candle flickering from the inside, especially when in a dimly lit room with your favourite aromas slowly filling the air. The burner is great quality and would be the perfect gift to give to someone with a selection of our fragrance oils to get them started. It measures approx. 12cm tall and 10cm wide.&nbsp;</p>

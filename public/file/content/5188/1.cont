	Fill your life with the peace and devotion of Goloka Nag Champa incense cones, a lighter, less heady, fragrance than the Satya Nag Champa incense yet still awash with calming aroma and ready to help you achieve inner peace. Nag Champa is one of the most popular and best-selling incenses in the world. Although it is not over-powering its fragrance will linger for hours without the acrid after scent you get with cheaper incense. Our Nag Champa incense cones are the original Shrinivas Sugandhalaya (made in India) and are export quality (beware of imitations). Each pack contains 12 cones and a holder for burning cones on. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

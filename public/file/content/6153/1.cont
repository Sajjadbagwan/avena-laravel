	These stunning looking tall sunflowers are perfect for adding to flower beds, plant pots and other areas around the garden. They have a sturdy copper spike and frame, with beautiful yellow and brown resin leaves. The leaves have an added sprinkle of glitter within the resin that glistens when caught by the sun. The&nbsp;centre&nbsp;of the sunflower is created by a suspended brown, marble sized ball that has copper twisted around it. The sunflowers stand at 88cm tall and 14cm wide at&nbsp;their widest point.&nbsp;</p>

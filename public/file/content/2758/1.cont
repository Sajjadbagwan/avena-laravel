	Gemstone wands have been used since ancient times to increase the power of spells. The pointed end of each wand directs the spell energy. Wands can be wrapped in silver or copper wire with other gemstones to personalise&nbsp;them for different uses. Wands are popular healing tools, used to channel energy in reflexology and massage. The stone should be chosen for its particular benefits and energies. Rose quartz wands are used to open the Heart or Throat Chakra. It channels energy in reflexology and massage&nbsp;to&nbsp;receive the healing properties directly through the skin. To relieve stress, place the&nbsp;wand at the Heart Chakra at the centre of the chest.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px;">These wands vary in length between 6cm and 8cm.</span></p>

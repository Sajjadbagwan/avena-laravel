	These large woolly sheep banks are made from porcelain with the main body covered in a soft wool effect, they then have beige feet, ears and comical face. The coin slot is in the top of the sheep but well hidden by the wool and a rubber bung is on the base for emptying the contents. At 14cm tall and 17cm long they are a good size and make a wonderful gift idea.</p>

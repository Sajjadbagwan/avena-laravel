	This mesmerising wind chime from Woodstock is made from a genuine hardwood with a dark wood finish and heavy duty coated nylon strings, whilst the tubes are a special aluminium alloy that will not rust. The clever design incorporates four small rods that harmonize beautifully with the six chime tubes. This wind chime recalls the soft melody of Johann Pachelbel&#39;s celebrated Canon in D. With its graceful melody and stately tempo, it is a popular choice as a wedding processional, for within its measures we hear the sounds of hope, joy, love and promise. This chime measures approximately 78cm long from the hook to the wind catcher and comes packed in a card box making it the perfect housewarming present. &copy; Please do not copy text.

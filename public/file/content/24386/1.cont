With a beautiful floral marine fragrance leading with top notes of lemon, grapefruit and orange to infuse the bath water, and cocoa and shea butter which will slowly melt. Let the creamy butters hug your skin as the marjoram &amp; bergamot essential oils work to comfort you from within.</p>

	How to use: Drop your Bomb Cosmetics Bath Mallow into a warm bath and it will fizz softly, releasing its moisturising Cocoa and Shea Fruit Butters into the water to moisturise your skin. Our Bath Mallows also contain wonderful perfumes and essential oils to make your bath smell beautiful. Please ensure you wash any petals away from the bath after use to prevent accidental staining.</p>

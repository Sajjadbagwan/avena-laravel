	Buddha is the ultimate symbol of happiness, wealth and good fortune. Buddha&#39;s belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity and by stroking it, it is believed to bring much good luck. Buddha was born around 565 B.C. in Lumbini, Northern India which in modern day is Nepal. Buddha translates to &#39;awakened one&#39;, therefore Buddhas should be carefully placed in the home in order to mark respect for this honourable teacher. To obtain the best of your Buddha&#39;s philosphy of wakening to reality, he can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office but avoid bathrooms, toilets and the floor. This lovely rose quartz (pink) Buddha is a great quality solid piece that is larger than the rose quartz ones we have had in the past, standing at approximately 50mm tall and 50mm wide. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

	<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A colourful chakra dream catcher. Chakra means wheel or disk and signifies one of seven basic energy centres in the body which are the openings for life energy to flow into and out of our aura. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. This dream catcher consists of seven discs to signify Chakra and each disc contains a handcrafted web design. The bottom of the hoop features three black dangling feathers. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams or important messages through.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;The overall length of the chakra dream catcher is approx. 70cm from the top of the hanger to the last feather and the first dream catcher circle is 7cm diameter then each decrease slightly in size to the last which is 3cm.</span></span></span></p>

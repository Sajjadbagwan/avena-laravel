	These Mercury chimes are made from a genuine hardwood with a bubinga wood and weather resistant finish with heavy duty coated nylon strings, whilst the tubes are a special aluminium alloy that will not rust and come with a one-year warranty. These wonderful Mercury chimes come carefully packed in boxes making them an ideal gift to give away as a set of three; or we won&rsquo;t tell anyone if you keep one to yourself and give the other two away! These chimes are designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance, they are hand-tuned to a universal, pentatonic (five-note) scale and acts in concert with the wind to create random patterns of wonderful sound. Ideal for indoor or outdoor use these high-quality chimes are relaxing and meditational. These chimes are named after the innermost planet in our solar system which, in turn, was named after the ancient Roman messenger god. Mercury is similar in appearance to the moon, with lots of craters and is normally not visible due to the glare of the sun; Mercury can be viewed in the morning or at twilight. These wonderful wind chimes are approximately 38cm long each and would make the perfect housewarming gift. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	A great pack of six different Canterbury Cathedral Gargoyles. Each gargoyle in this set is a replica of a real gargoyle that can be found on Canterbury Cathedral in Kent, England. Made from resin these great gargoyles are finished in a green stone effect and are ideal for use outside being waterproof and frost proof and look great as plant pot decorations hidden in walls, around the garden or dotted around the rockery.&nbsp; They&nbsp;are also are just as happy sitting inside and&nbsp;all six gargoyles could be kept together for a display, dotted around the house in different rooms or given as individual gifts. They are packed into one of our plain card boxes making a great gift. The size of the gargoyles varies slightly but the average is approx 5cm tall.</p>

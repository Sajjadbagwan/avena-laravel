	This piece is named &lsquo;Comfort&rsquo; and is such a fitting description. From the &lsquo;Fairy Dreams&rsquo; collection this piece is truly beautiful and a popular seller in our shop. Made from solid resin and quite a heavy piece at over 1kg the detail and colour is superb throughout. The fairy stands approx 21cm tall and is comforting the unicorn. They are both on a snow covered stone base and are carefully packed in polystyrene and a &lsquo;Fairy Dreams&rsquo; gift box making an ideal addition to any collection or perfect gift idea.</p>

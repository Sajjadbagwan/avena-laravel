Scrub that and feel fortified. This refreshing and energising facial scrub will give your skin a new lease of life. It has an oil-free base that cleanses and tones the skin, giving it a smoother, more vibrant appearance. Made from natural exfoliators including coconut rind and crushed olive seeds, the scrub helps remove particles that block the pores and interfere with the skin&rsquo;s ability to replenish itself. Aloe vera juice has been added to the blend to help soothe skin irritation, giving this quality formula its final finish. Apply a small amount onto your wet face and using small circular motions, gently massage the entire face &ndash; avoiding the eye contour and rinse off. Use twice a week. This luxurious 100g/3.53oz face scrub is formulated without parabens, propylene glycol, petroleum derivative, silicone, synthetic colours and fragrances or animal ingredients.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222; font-size: 9pt"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

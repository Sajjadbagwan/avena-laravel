	These wonderfully unique stones are already proving to be a big hit in our shop. Made for the outdoors they can withstand the elements and are frost resistant but are just as happy indoors looking great on any shelf, desk, fireplace or getting interesting looks if placed on a windowsill smiling out at passers-by and neighbours! They are great in a porch or on a step as a welcome smile for arriving guests or can be used as a door stop, paperweight etc. and would be ideal for any dentist! They are made from quality resin and have a granite type finish to them; they are solid, sturdy and quite heavy. Set in the centre of the stone is a set of very realistic shiny smiling teeth. The teeth then have a metal zip attached around them! Why? We have no idea but love them or hate them they are selling fast! They are solid, durable and great quality making a fantastic and different gift idea and they come in a fab gift box. These stones measure approximately H12cm x W11cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	A wonderful gift pack of incense. Tulasi incense is the small box that packs a big punch! This gift pack contains six boxes of incense sticks, each box then contains eight highly fragranced incense sticks that burn for approximately forty minutes each, these really are a great value boxes for their size. Tulasi incense direct from India and hand rolled expertly captures the true essence of fragrance and leaves you with a beautifully scented home. This incense is fantastic quality and only has to be opened to really appreciate the wonderful aromas. It is quite normal to place these incense sticks around the house without lighting them for a few days as the fragrances can be appreciated for days before burning.</p>

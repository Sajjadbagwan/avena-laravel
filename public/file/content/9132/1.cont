	We all know the painful, burning and itching sensation after shaving whether with a razor or an electric shaver. Our fantastic After Shave Cream is blended together using pure essential oils reputed to help moisturise and protect sensitive skin with a fresh smelling aroma, helping to eliminate razor burn and to rehydrate the skin.</p>
<p>
	Our After Shave Cream provides a wonderful alternative to alcohol based after shave products while deeply moisturising and soothing your skin. Our After Shave Cream contains a base of polysorbate 20 which has a soothing effect on your skin; cetearyl alcohol which is well known to effectively condition and soften the skin; glyceryl stearate (derived from palm kernel, vegetable or soy oil and also found naturally in the human body) which penetrates the skin and slows the loss of water from the skin by forming a barrier on the skin&rsquo;s surface; phenoxyethanol which is used in many natural creams as a preservative and an alternative to parabens; water to moisturise your skin and a drop of enriching vitamin-e oil. The cream base is then carefully blended together with natural and pure essential oils of peppermint essential oil, for its freshness and cooling properties; and patchouli essential oil for its antiseptic properties. Our After Shave Cream is a very popular unisex lotion and is also useful for moisturising legs and under arms after shaving.</p>

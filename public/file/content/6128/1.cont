	Get fruity with this lovely looking candle made with a blend of pink grapefruit and mandarin fragrances! The candle will give you hours of burning time to enjoy the beautiful fragrance. This candle is so much more useful than an ordinary candle as the lid can be put back between uses to preserve the fragrance and as it is compact could be used as a travel candle. When in use place the candle tin on a heat resistant surface away from draughts. Ensure the candle is kept away from any flammable materials and do not move the candle while alight or while the wax is molten. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not leave a burning candle unattended. This lovely candle in a tin measures approximately 5cm in diameter.</p>

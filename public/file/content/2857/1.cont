	These beautiful Ashleigh &amp; Burwood Relaxing Synergies square tealight candles have a special blend of orange and lavender essential oils whose energies and beneficial aromatherapy powers are delightfully enhanced by their union. The candles are unusual in that they are square in design and are beautifully coloured in crystalline wax. Ideal for display in the home and also as a refill to our delightful Synergies square tealight gift set. Each tealight is made from 100% palm oil wax, which is taken from managed&nbsp;and sustainable palm plantations. A much more environmentally sound choice than paraffin wax, they are also much cleaner and longer burning. Each candle burns for approx 5 hours! Pack contains 6 tealights.</p>

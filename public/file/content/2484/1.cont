	A lovely ceramic stoneware oil burner with a fantastic green crackle glaze in the burning dish. The burner has an unglazed exterior and has an authentic stone look that is rough to the touch. It then has the moon and star cut-outs that look fantastic with a candle flickering from the inside, especially when in a dimly lit room with your favourite aromas slowly filling the air. The burner is great quality and is not one of the cheaper imports. It measures 85mm tall and 90mm across the base. A truly lovely item and a great gift idea.</p>

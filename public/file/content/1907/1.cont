	Kids love sharks&#39; teeth and this fantastic pack is a great addition to our fossil range. A generous cluster of teeth comes complete with a handy pull-out information card and it&#39;s all packed in a quality plastic case. Ideal for any fossil collector or any shark fan these are a very popular line in our shop.&nbsp;All shark teeth in these products are fossilised, and therefore came from sharks that lived and died many millions of years ago. They are mostly a by-product from phosphate mines and so have no connection with living sharks or the fishing industry.</p>

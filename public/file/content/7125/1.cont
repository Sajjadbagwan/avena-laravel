	This unusual 3D notebook is designed by the popular artist Lisa Parker, illustrating dark, blue and black colours with the fantastic wolf&#39;s head surrounded with branches and the moon shining in the night sky. The cover page of this fantastic 3D effect notebook is made with layers of images topped with a clear lens coating that create the impression of depth in the picture.&nbsp;This stunning notebook would make the perfect idea paired up with one of our matching bookmarks.</p>

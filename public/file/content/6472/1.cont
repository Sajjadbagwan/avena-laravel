	This large incense tower is beautifully carved on each side ensuring that the smoke of your favourite incense escapes and fills the room. The incense holder is hand made in India and has been finished with wonderful inlaid brass pattern (which can vary). Simply light the tip of your incense stick, blow the flame out and place in the specially designed holes then sit back and enjoy indulgent relaxation with beautiful aroma. Due to the size of the wooden tower you have the option of burning four incense sticks and a cone at the same time, so you can combine your favourite fragrances to create your own unique aroma.</p>

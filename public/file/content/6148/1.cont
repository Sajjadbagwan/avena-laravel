	This hanging dotty butterfly is made from felt using a mixture of lovely bright colours. It&nbsp;is attached to a red silk loop hanger so can be hung easily on walls, windows, doors or wherever takes your fancy. It would look beautiful and be a great accessory in a child&#39;s bedroom. The butterfly measures 11cm wide and 13cm long. Windhors<strong>e</strong>&nbsp;is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. They build real&nbsp;and lasting connections with their suppliers and give all suppliers a fair price, whilst also monitoring fair wages&nbsp;and good working conditions.&nbsp;The business is owned by a charity, which donates money to social projects in the communities of our suppliers, and also to Buddhist projects around the world. An example of one of their projects is the centre for disabled people in Bali. &quot;For several years, with our supplier, we have been donating to a project for disabled children and adults in the town of Ubud, which is the local town of the villages where we buy our goods. This is the Kupu-Kupu project. Begonia, a Spanish social worker, started the project because she saw that disabled children in Bali are often isolated and unable to leave their houses. The Kupu-Kupu Foundation provides wheelchairs (plus lessons in how to use them) and transport to its centre in the town of Ubud that doubles as a school and community centre. There they have lessons, craft making, yoga, and meet others in similar situations. A few years ago another day centre in the district of Bangli was opened and this building was entirely paid for by us&quot;.</p>

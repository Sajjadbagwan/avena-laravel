	A fizzy ice-cream and soda fragranced bath blaster, sandwiching a divine cocoa butter swirl and containing pure amyris and thyme essential oils to perk you up and leave you glowing in all your glory! Its wild fruit and red berry notes blend seamlessly with a creamy vanilla base to make a mouth-watering fragrance. The knickerbocker glory bath blaster comes individually wrapped in cellophane making it an ideal gift. To use simply place your whoopie blaster in warm water and watch as it fizzes rapidly releasing its fragrance and essential oils.&nbsp;Remember to only allow a portion of your whoopee blaster to dissolve and remove the rest from the bath so it can be saved for later as each bath blaster can be used up to four times. Please rinse petals or decorations away from the bath immediately after use to prevent accidental staining.

	For anyone wondering what a carrier oil is, the answer is very straightforward, a carrier oil is a base oil used in aromatherapy to which essential oils are added before the mixture contacts the skin. As such, they are an essential part of the aromatherapy process as, essential oils should not be directly applied to the skin.</p>
<p>
	Carrier oils are best used as massage oils or bathing oils, blended with essential oils or even used alone as a moisturising base.</p>

	As a general rule, carrier oils are odourless and are easily absorbed by the skin. Different carrier oils may be used in aromatherapy, depending on the desired outcome, as each has its own unique properties. For example, two carrier oils which differ greatly in their viscosity, and therefore how quickly and easily they can be absorbed by the skin are grapeseed oil and olive oil. Carrier oils are generally produced by cold pressing or macerating of the base material, and they are produced from a wide range of materials: avocado, olive, evening primrose and sunflower are examples of some commonly used carrier oils. &nbsp;</p>

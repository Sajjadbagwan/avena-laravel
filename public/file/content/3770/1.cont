	<span style="line-height: 17.77px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0,0,0); font-size: 12.22px">This is an absolutely fantastic gift set complete with a handcrafted fragrance lamp, utilising the century old catalytic combustion technique,&nbsp;and a bottle of fragrance oil. The stunning fragrance lamp is hand crafted and designed with a delicate mosaic finish in beautiful shades of bronze and gold,&nbsp;which glisten beautifully&nbsp;when caught by the light. The design comes with a gold snuffer cap and decorative cap for when it&rsquo;s at work evaporating and sending out the delicious orange and cinnamon aroma around the room. The fragranced lamp oil comes in a decorated clear plastic bottle, with a well presented label on the front. It&rsquo;s a 250ml bottle, the perfect size to get started as it should last approximately 10 hours. They are both presented in a wonderful black gift box with golden calligraphy and designs on the lid and around the sides. The lamp itself is approx. 12cm tall, the box being approx. 15cm long and 10cm wide. To use the lamp simply place the fragranced lamp oil inside. Insert the wick into the fragrance with the stone placed on top and leave to soak for around 20-30 minutes. Place the lamp on a heat resistant surface and light the stone. (Be aware that the flame may become quite high and the stone&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 17.77px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0,0,0); font-size: 12.22px">will get&nbsp;hot.) Leave the flame lit for around 2-3 minutes without any caps over it, then simply blow the flame out. Place the decorative cap supplied over the stone as the lamp gets to work evaporating the fragrance. To stop it, simply take the decorative cap off, (be careful as it may be hot!!) and place the snuffer cap over the stone, this will stop the fragrance from evaporating.</span></p>

	These howlite wind chimes with five metal tubes of assorted sizes&nbsp;give a wonderful melodic tone as the breeze passes through them and not the dull or high pitched sounds you get with some wind chimes. The top of the chime and hanger are both quality dark wood and the chime with&nbsp;three howlite balls and a round howlite piece comes ready assembled and packed in a long white box for safe transit and also making an ideal gift (especially as a housewarming present). Howlite&nbsp;is said to&nbsp;eliminate rage and calm violent, uncontrolled anger as well as being believed to be&nbsp;good for teeth and bones. This beautiful wind chime is approx. 49cm long and 6.5cm wide. The soothing tones seem to have a calming effect on the senses and are thought by some to relieve stress and worry. This is an ethically traded product.</p>

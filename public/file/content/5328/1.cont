	Nowadays, a rushed lifestyle means there is little time to research something before making a decision.</p>
<p>
	Massage and facial oils are designed to help you relax and forget about the pains of the day, but many people are yet to realise their true potential.</p>
<p>
	With such a vast array of oils on the market, here&rsquo;s a sneaky peak at the subtle differences between the two, and why one or the other may just be right for you.</p>
<h3>
	Massage Oils</h3>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;">With the properties of massage oils all linked to helping reduce the effects of arthritis and rheumatism; they are certainly likely to assist in improving your day and the way you feel.</span></p>
<p>
	All are designed to relax the body and reduce the tension in your muscles, making it easier to move and getting a little closer to being pain-free.</p>
<p>
	Dry, itchy or annoyed skin can also be tackled with a drop of massage oil, ideal for solving those little problems that bug you on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, some oils can help to restore over-exerted muscles by increasing blood circulation and releasing tension in body tissue.</p>

<h3>
	Facial Oils</h3>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;">In a bid for clearer and softer skin, facial oils are often the first port of call while they are also ideal for preventing spots and assisting in the treatment of skin conditions.</span></p>
<p>
	Many oils moisturise the skin, giving it a more natural glow and that can go a long way to improving your outlook on life.</p>
<p>
	By penetrating deep in to your skin they can help to repair, restore and revitalise your outer layer, giving your skin a much more healthy appearance overall.</p>
<p>
	But if you really can&rsquo;t make up your mind as to which you prefer, try mixing a couple together and enjoy the enhanced experience that your experimenting will bring.</p>

	This stunning mushroom ornament is made with a lot of attention to detail, coloured red with white spots and finished with a white metal stick. This fantastic ornament is made from quality polyresin and thanks to the metal stick it is ideal to place anywhere in the garden inbetween flowers, in larger plant pots etc. This decorative mushroom ornament would also make a cracking decoration indoors. This fantastic ornament is frost resistant and winter should not be an issue but to prolong the appearance it can move indoors for the harsher months. Treated for protection from the sun&rsquo;s UV rays, this ornament over time will deteriorate so to keep it in top condition a lacquer or varnish is a good idea to apply at the beginning of Spring if required. This wonderful mushroom would make the ideal gift idea for someone who is a lover of garden ornaments and would make the perfect addition to an existing mushroom/toadstool collection. This ornament measures H19cm x W10cm at the widest points including the stick. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Garden Fungi on Stick Red Top.</p>

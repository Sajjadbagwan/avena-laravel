	This fantastic bongo drum is a handcrafted product from&nbsp;Indonesia and is made in Bali. It is hand painted with a brilliant and colourful design around the bottom half of the drum, the rest being dark wood. The drum has a&nbsp;useful small handle on the side so it is easy to carry and play at the same time. The drum is approximately 12cm tall and 10cm wide, making it the perfect little gift for someone or even&nbsp;as a treat for&nbsp;yourself. As this lovely piece is hand crafted and painted the designs may vary slightly&nbsp;from this image.</p>

	A fantastic garden meerkat, ideal for any lawn, patio or garden. This Meerkat is designed for outside display during all weathers, however we recommend it is not left out during severe frost or snow. A comical piece where the head is emerging from its burrow and with great colour and detail. A good size measuring 18cm High and 22cm wide it would suit any garden or make an ideal gift.</p>

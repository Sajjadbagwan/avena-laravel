	These fantastic small stone faces make brilliant and novel garden ornaments. Designed to make you smile when you see them with their big lovable eyes and puffy cheeks they have a comical and cheeky look about them with the wide smile on their faces. They would bring a bit of cheer and humour to any part of the garden, patio, and windowsill or in a conservatory etc. These cute faces are made from quality resin with a white stone wash finish. They are also hollow so are not too heavy but can be filled with sand or similar to be weighed down if needed. They are suitable for indoors or outside however we don&rsquo;t recommend they are left out during severe frost.These medium stone faces are approximately 9cm wide and 8cm tall.</p>

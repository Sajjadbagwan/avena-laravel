	This lovely sheep design magnet is from the ever popular &#39;The Whimsical World of&nbsp;Thomas Joseph&#39; range. Thomas Joseph Stephenson,&nbsp;from the Irish Carrick Fergus, on the shore of Belfast Lough&nbsp;is famous for painting many subjects including sheep, landscapes&nbsp;and&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;people. This lovely magnet is 9cm long and 6.5cm wide and comes in a cellophane bag which makes it the perfect gift or addition to an existing magnet&nbsp;collection,&nbsp;sheep collection or both.&nbsp; This amusing magnet&nbsp;shows&nbsp;two sheep standing&nbsp;side by side&nbsp;next to a drystone wall with a bunch of cows on the other side&nbsp;with the quote &#39;Nag Nag Nag&#39;.</p>

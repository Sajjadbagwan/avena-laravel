	This amazing piece is made of resin with a lot of attention to detail. The dragon is sat at one end of the holder looking like he is warning something off, with his wings protecting his body. His tail is then elongated along the side of the holder with the arrow shaped tip wrapping around the end. Near his tail there are rocks/crystals and three small skulls. These may be his possessions that he&#39;s protecting. The holder is finished with a metallic look and is approx. 30cm long and 8cm tall. To use simply place your favourite smelling incense stick inside the dragon&rsquo;s mouth. Light the stick and let it burn until the tip glows, then simply blow out and enjoy the fragrance.</p>

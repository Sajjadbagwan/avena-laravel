For those who don&rsquo;t like burning incense, or who prefer to be more eco-friendly than using plug-in room fresheners, a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting and stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. With normal use the liquid will last for up to 4 months so will easily last you through the festive season! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and sit back whilst the fragrance is absorbed through the sticks and evaporated across the room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px">This cactus candle looks fantastic making it a brilliant decorative piece for any room. The candle is presented in a glass holder and the wax is slightly different shades making it look like the cactus is planted in the holder. The cactus part of the candle is made from green wax and has been moulded to look spiky with the candle wick in the middle. It also has a few small pebbles around the bottom to add to the effect. It would look fantastic on a fireplace, coffee table or simply in a window, it would also be a fantastic candle to put on a table outside on a summer&#39;s day. The candle measures 6.5cm tall and 6cm wide.</span></p>

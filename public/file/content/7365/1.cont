	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This unusual word block is made of wood and attached to it there is a thin wooden heart that is covered with cream and red tartan fabric. The block is cream in colour with a lined stitching effect going around the edges. It was made to make the readers giggle as the writing goes &quot;Both of us can&rsquo;t look good&hellip; it&rsquo;s either the house or me!&quot;. This funny wooden block would make the perfect gift for someone who takes a joke well or for Mothers&rsquo; Day as we all know that mums work so hard that they hardly get any time for themselves; it would look good on any shelf, windowsill or on the fireplace etc. as it is not just for a laugh but is a decorative piece as well. The block measures 15cm long and 6cm tall including the heart in height.</span></p>

	This delicious smelling bath blaster is blended with luscious fruity mango and pineapple notes highlighted with cocoa and shea butter finished with pure essential oils. This fantastic bath blaster comes individually wrapped in cellophane making it an ideal gift. To use simply place your whoopie blaster in warm water and watch as it fizzes rapidly releasing its fragrance and essential oils. Remember to only allow a portion of your whoopee blaster to dissolve and remove the rest from the bath so it can be saved for later as each bath blaster can be used up to four times. Please rinse petals or decorations away from the bath immediately after use to prevent accidental staining.

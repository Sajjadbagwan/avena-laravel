	This unique oil burner is made from terracotta and consists of a ring of six little figures linking arms creating a circle around the tealight holder, with a great raw aesthetic. It comes with a removable glass dish that sits on top of the figures, so you can choose whether to use it as a candle holder or an oil burner, making it much more flexible for any occasion. The removable glass dish makes it much easier to clean and maintain.

	A very beautiful and eye catching rose quartz candle holder. This piece is 100% natural so each piece is unique. The wonderful rose quartz may be slightly lighter or darker than our picture. The size and shape will vary for each piece but will be approx 12cm across x 6cm tall and weigh approx 1kg. What you are guaranteed is that this is a beautiful piece which is 100% unique to you. This is a natural rough stone product that is not cut to any exact dimensions, meaning the shape and size of the item can vary slightly from the picture shown as could the colour, shade and/or pattern where applicable. We always choose the best quality stone products from reputable importers we have met and trust but we can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change the imagges as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help or send an image of a piece we have here.</p>

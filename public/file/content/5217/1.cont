	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This smaller round owl is the baby from our family set of three. He has a wonderful cartoon look about him with adorable big eyes, exaggerated beak showing his pink tongue and a tuft of tail feathers to the rear. How could you not fall in love with him? He oozes cheeky character, looking like he just want to play but at the same time be so loveable yet mischievous. Made from quality resin he is suitable for outdoor use as part of our garden range (although we recommend that he is not left out during harsh, frosty weather and very bad winters) but also makes a lovely indoors ornament and great gift idea individually or as part of the set. This baby owl measures at 11cm tall and 13cm wide.</span></p>

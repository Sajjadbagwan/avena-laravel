	A festive selection of six fragrance oils that are perfect for those cosy winter nights and days with their warm and spicy aromas. These lovely oils are stored in a decorative wooden oil box which is an essential tool when keeping or transporting your oils because it protects them from light when not in use and prolongs their freshness. Each Christmas Fragrance Oil Box contains a 10ml bottle each of Christmas mix, cinnamon, cranberry, frankincense &amp; myrrh and sandalwood fragrance oils plus the vintage looking wooden storage box. If purchased separately this set would cost &pound;24.96 - our Christmas oils offer is for all these oils and the box for only &pound;19.99!</p>

	The description and image for each gift set is accurate when added to our website but should any item be out of stock we may replace this with a similar item and the boxes can alternate between the two images as they are proving hard to get hold of. This will mean there&#39;s no delay for delivery but we would only do this with an item of the same or higher value. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	George the scarecrow would make a novelty and fun addition to any garden, patio, greenhouse, planter etc. He is a very cheeky looking scarecrow with a big smile and rosy cheeks and he&#39;s wearing orange trousers with a bright checked shirt, all decorated with sunflowers; in addition he is accessorised with a cute neckerchief and a fun hat. This charming scarecrow has straw hands and feet and comes attached to a wooden stick ready to place in and around the garden; it is very popular with adults and children alike. This garden scarecrow is very well made and suitable for indoor and outdoor use but due to the nature of the product we would not recommend leaving it out in bad weather. George the scarecrow measures approximately 35.5cm long including the wooden stick.</p>

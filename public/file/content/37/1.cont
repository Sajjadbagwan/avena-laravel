	<span style="font-size:16px;">All our essential oils are 100% pure, natural, concentrated oils. We do sell a handful of blends of the very expensive oils alongside the absolutes to make them a little more affordable and these are clearly marked &lsquo;blend&rsquo; within the title, description and on the bottle. Ours may not be the cheapest essential oils you will find online but we also supply these&nbsp;trade to aromatherapists, chiropodists, shops, perfume manufacturers and other herbalists meaning we have to supply the best quality and freshest oils we can. As a result the cost can be a little higher than some of the cheaper brands but you are assured of the quality associated with Avena. Some essential oils you find in some (not all) health food stores and on the high street are so low in quality and full of adulterations it would shock you as even essential oils labelled as pure are not always what they seem. </span></p>

	This wonderful lapis lazuli wind chime is made from a genuine ash wood with a black wood finish and heavy duty coated nylon strings, whilst the tubes are a special aluminium alloy that will not rust. This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance with a genuine stone accent, making it as eye-catching as it is pleasing to the ear. Lapis lazuli represents the Brow Chakra - related to intuition and clarity. Often referred to as the &quot;third eye&quot;, when working properly the Brow Chakra provides a sharp, clear memory and enhances our ability to reason. It allows us to trust our intuition and know instinctively what to do for ourselves and for others. Lapis lazuli helps us to see both literally and intuitively and eliminates negative feelings. A great quality chime that is a good size measuring 45cm in total and individually carefully packed in its own box making a lovely gift. &copy; Please do not copy text.

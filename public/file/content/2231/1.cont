	Tiger&#39;s Eye is the confidence stone and is said to inspire brave but sensible behaviour and a positive attitude. It is also believed to aid the digestive system. This heart is our small size measuring approx 25mm wide and weighing approx 10g. Gemstone hearts are cut and highly polished natural semi-precious stones and come in a wide range of shapes and varieties of stone. Each has their own unique properties and are ideal to use as a worry stone, keeping in your hand, pocket or bag wherever you go. They can be placed under your pillow at night, used for meditation or chakra healing, simply as a way to collect some wonderful semi-precious stones or as an ideal gift idea they fit perfectly into our mini drawstring pouches. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

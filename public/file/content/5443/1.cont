	<span style="font-size: 12px">This bronze Saturn chime is made from genuine hardwood with a bubinga wood finish. It has&nbsp;four bronze aluminium tubes and is 47 inches in its overall length. It is named after the brightly-ringed sixth planet from the sun. This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance. It is hand-tuned to a universal, pentatonic (five-note) scale and acts in concert with the wind to create random patterns of wonderful sound. This Saturn chime also harmonises beautifully with all the other Woodstock chimes. It would make a great chime for any home and comes securely packed in its own box.</span></p>

	This eye-catching mirror box is made of composite wood, covered in fabric and lined with a velvet effect material with a velvet underside. The art work shown on this charming box is a design by Linda M. Jones, showing a ginger tabby cat hiding in long meadow grass amongst flowers in the company of ladybirds. The 7cm x 7cm wide mirror and the black velvet cover on the inside of the box make it a fantastic accessory to store jewellery, hair accessories or make up etc. This lovely cat mirror box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who loves pretty accessories or would make the perfect addition to an existing tabby collection. The box measures 10cm x 10cm wide and comes in a decorative card box.</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;">On the front of&nbsp;this cool, dancing Elvis flip flap there is a solar panel which powers the dancing motion. His hand with a microphone moves up and down as his hips sway from side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get him dancing, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not suitable for children under three years&nbsp;of age&nbsp;due to small parts. He comes packed and displayed in a clear acetate box for protection in the post and makes the perfect gift for an Elvis fan, or would look great dancing on your stereo, in your car or on the windowsill. He is 11cm tall x 5.5cm wide.</span></p>

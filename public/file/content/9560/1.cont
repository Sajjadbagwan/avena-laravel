	A wonderful gift set of six natural ointments from Avena. Buying six together not only gives you a natural ointment for nearly everything you could possibly need one for but it also works out cheaper than buying them individually and makes a nice gift set which can be given away as a whole package or can be split up and given out as individual gifts while keeping some for yourself. Alternatively they could all be kept for your own indulgence and we won&rsquo;t tell anyone. We will also include a special 25% off voucher which you can use on your next order or pass on if they are a gift. The natural Avena ointments included are- Comfrey Ointment 60ml, Calendula Ointment 60ml, Lavender Ointment 60ml, Tea Tree ointment 60ml, Vitamin-E Balm 60ml and Wintergreen Ointment 60ml. All of which are our best-sellers in this range. Descriptions and uses for each can be found on the individual listings but all are beautiful hand made balms with top quality natural ingredients, they are parabens and SLS free, they don&rsquo;t contain alcohol or any nasties and even the jars and lids are recyclable. &copy; Please do not copy text.

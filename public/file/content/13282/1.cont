	Obsidian is a lovely black stone with a beautiful pattern throughout. Known as the stone of purity bringing balance to body, mind and spirit, it is also said to be beneficial for the skin and veins. This highly polished egg is approximately 5cm tall; they sit nicely on our egg stands for display or are a perfect fit in our drawstring pouches for safe storage or for a gift. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we will be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Mahogany Obsidian Egg.</p>

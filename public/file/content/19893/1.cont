	Our Luxury Body Cream cream provides a wonderful massage glide and is rich in ingredients for nourishing, conditioning and moisturising the skin. To lock in more moisture it is great to use while the skin is slightly moist after showering or bathing.</p>
<p>
	Our Luxury Body Cream contains a base of polysorbate 20 which has a soothing effect on your skin; cetearyl alcohol which is well known to effectively condition and soften the skin; glyceryl stearate (derived from palm kernel, vegetable or soy oil and also found naturally in the human body) which penetrates the skin and slows the loss of water from the skin by forming a barrier on the skin&rsquo;s surface; phenoxyethanol which is used in many natural creams as a preservative and an alternative to parabens; water to moisturise your skin and a drop of enriching vitamin-e oil. The cream base is then carefully blended together with natural and pure essential oil of frankincense which is great for toning and refreshing the skin and is used in many creams and lotions. Directions to use: apply spots of the cream around the body before gently massaging in.</p>

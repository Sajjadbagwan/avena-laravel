	This fantastic looking wind spiral is completed with clear and purple glass ball insets, string and hook making it the perfect accessory for any garden, patio or conservatory. This mesmerising spiral twister comes fully assembled so all you have to do is finding the perfect spot for it and leave the rest to the wind! This decorative wind spiral is made from quality stainless steel that will not rust or tarnish whilst outside. To keep it maintained it may just require an occasional light wash with rust proof window or stainless steel cleanser. This marvellous spiral would also make the perfect complement to any wind spinner by attaching it to the bottom of the spinner and would make a wonderful addition to any home. As this spiral twists in the wind, when in motion, the balls appear to travel up and down the tail creating a hypnotising illusion. The spiral measures approximately 30cm long plus 32cm of the string and hook. Please note that unless it is attached to a wind spinner it does require a strong wind to turn fully but alternatively you could use a battery powered motor. &copy; Please do not copy text.

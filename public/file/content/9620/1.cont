	This eye-catching tarot box is made of composite wood, covered in fabric and lined with a velvet effect material with a velvet underside. The art work shown on this eye-catching box is a design by Lisa Parker, showing a black cat sitting by a spell book while the full moon illuminates the sky in the background. Celtic designs decorate the side of this fantastic box. The black velvet on the inside of the box makes it a fantastic accessory to store your tarot cards to keep them away from negative vibes. This lovely cat tarot box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who practices tarot or perhaps a lover of cats and would also make a great addition to an existing Lisa Parker collection.

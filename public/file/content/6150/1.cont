	This hanging dotty butterfly is made from felt using a mixture of lovely bright colours. It&nbsp;is attached to a red silk loop hanger so can be hung easily on walls, windows, doors or wherever takes your fancy. It would look beautiful and be a great accessory in a child&#39;s bedroom. The butterfly measures 11cm wide and 13cm long. Windhors<strong>e</strong>&nbsp;is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. They build real&nbsp;and lasting connections with their suppliers and give all suppliers a fair price, whilst also monitoring fair wages&nbsp;and good working conditions.&nbsp;The business is owned by a charity, which donates money to social projects in the communities of our suppliers, and also to Buddhist projects around the world. An example of a project they carried out in previous years is, they bought a range of Mayan-inspired gifts from suppliers in Guatemala. With the money they made from selling these products, they worked in partnership with charities around this area to help fund the building of three new schools, meaning more children were able to attend and receive an education in a safe and secure environment.</p>

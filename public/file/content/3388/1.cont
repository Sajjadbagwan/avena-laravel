Great quality stone Meerkats ideal for outdoor or indoor use. Rain and frost proof each Meerkat comes with a metal (wood for the smallest) rod and has a hole in the base, the rod then can be stuck into the soil, plant pot or lawn to keep them upright in the wind. These are sturdy and solid (not the cheaper hollow types) and have great quality and colour. Our Meekats would be happy to live in your garden, plant pots, rockeries etc. but are also just as happy indoors and make lovely ornaments and a super gift idea.

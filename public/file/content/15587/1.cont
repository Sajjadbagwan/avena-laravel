	A beautiful candle in a tin scented with delicate jasmine tea to evoke feelings of love and positivity. Ideal to burn on those days when you need a little boost!</p>
<p>
	The stunning image on the top and the side of candle is created by the beloved artist, Lisa Parker. The top of the tin shows two white unicorns gazing into each other&rsquo;s eyes &ndash; a mare and her foal. As they touch noses lovingly, the tips of their spiralling horns light up. Behind them, a magical forest can be indistinctly made out in the night. The same design repeats on the side.</p>
<p>
	When in use place the candle tin on a heat resistant surface. Ensure the candle is kept away from any flammable materials and do not move the candle while alight or while the wax is molten. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not leave a burning candle unattended.</p>

	This candle is suitable for vegans and has a burn time of 30 hours. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Sacred Love Unicorn Candle in a Tin.<br />

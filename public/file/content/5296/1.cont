	<span style="font-size: 12px">This fairy is a beautiful looking piece (in our view) and ideal for any time of year. The piece itself is named &lsquo;A Closer Look&rsquo; and that is exactly what she is doing.&nbsp;She is kneeling on a large mushroom gazing at a purple coloured butterfly that has landed on the mushroom with her. Around her on the ground are rocks, autumn coloured leaves and also a smaller mushroom identical to the one she is perched on. The wonderful colours that have been used on this fairy and her surroundings are fantastic and the detail is perfect from her delicate facial features to the hair draped along her face and her patterned tights, with beautiful intricate leaves on the ground. She is 18cm tall and comes packaged in a nice &lsquo;Fairy Dreams&#39; box making an ideal gift.</span></p>

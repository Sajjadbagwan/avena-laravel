	We like to gently massage our pulse points with this spicy-sweet scent when we are trying to concentrate. The aroma of nutmeg is said to help clear the head, whilst black pepper oil is believed to produce feelings of warmth, and kaffir lime a sense of rejuvenation. Dab it on your temples and wrists or simply sniff the bottle&nbsp;up to&nbsp;2-3 times daily. This luxurious pulse point roller is formulated without parabens, propylene glycol, petroleum derivative, silicone, synthetic colours and fragrances&nbsp;or animal ingredients.</p>

	Indulge yourself with this gorgeous hand and body lotion to give skin that feels fabulous and silky smooth. This lotion is rich in essential oils including calming and sensual combinations of water lily and freesia held together with deep undertones of rose to comfort and soothe.The name Winter in Venice comes from a young British entrepreneur&rsquo;s journey to Venice in the winter of 2005 on a soul-searching mission. She wanted to get to a place in her mind where she would be inspired emotionally and she found this in Venice where she had the inspiration to create a range of pamper gifts unlike any other. A few years on, and Winter in Venice has created a different, unusual, unique and truly gorgeous range of gifts and luxury natural toiletries. We find that people tend to think that quality costs more. Whilst this may be true in some cases, Winter in Venice believe that there is a lot more to this industry than making enormous profits and have developed a luxurious range of products with a realistic price tag. We decided to sell their products as they are a company that love what they do and we know you will too.</p>

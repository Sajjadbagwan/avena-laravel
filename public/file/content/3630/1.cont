<p>This wonderful piece titled &lsquo;Unleashed&rsquo; is designed by fantasy illustrator Tom Woods, a best-selling poster artist in the US and Canada. It depicts an enormous red dragon that is beginning to break free of its restraints, as the wizard who had once hoped to enslave it starts to realise that it&rsquo;s far too powerful to be controlled. A fantastic piece that has been much talked about and admired since we put it out in our shop display. Of great quality and colour it measures 240mm tall and 230mm wide&nbsp; and is a solid piece weighing 1.5kg. &nbsp;</p>

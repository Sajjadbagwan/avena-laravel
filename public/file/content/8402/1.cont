	Enjoy your favourite incense cones in true style with this delightful carved incense cone burner in the shape of a barrel. Made from sheesham wood which is hard Indian rosewood, each barrel has been waxed to bring out the natural colours and graining of the wood. Simply light the tip of your incense cone, blow the flame out and place in the specially designed hole in the middle of the box then sit back and enjoy indulgent relaxation with the beautiful aroma. You can even close the little door and allow the smoke to evenly drift through the tiny holes of the side of the barrel and gently fill your home with gorgeous scents. This incense holder is ideal for keeping your furniture safe from any unwanted burn marks or messy falling ash. This stunning incense burner makes a beautiful gift when accompanied with some Avena incense cones. This incense cone burner stands 9.5cm tall and is 7,5cm in diameter. &copy; Please do not copy text- Avena product description- Incense Barrel with Door.</p>

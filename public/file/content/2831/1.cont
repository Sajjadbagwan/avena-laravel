	Silicon carbide is a compound of silicon and carbon. Natural silicon carbide is extremely rare, and known as the mineral moissanite. The brown to black colour of industrial product results from iron impurities. All our stones are fantastic quality, rich in colour, smooth and polished. The average stone is 20-30mm but this does vary slightly as each is a unique natural shape and they make a fantastic gift idea.</p>

	Cedar roses are very pretty cones from the cedar tree. They make excellent table decorations or&nbsp;can be added to potpourri or gift baskets. They are widely used in all sorts of crafts and are even thought to be useful as a moth repellent. Each cone is about 4-6cm across and they are quite solid, great quality and not really fragile like some dried products that have bits constantly falling off. They are great sellers all year round but are especially popular for Christmas and Autumnal displays. Sold in handy bags of&nbsp;ten cones.</p>

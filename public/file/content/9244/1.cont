	On the front of this novel policeman flip flap there is a solar panel which powers the swinging motion. His hips, with one arm indicating to stop, sway from side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get him swaying, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not suitable for children under three years of age due to small parts. He comes packed and displayed in a clear acetate box for protection in the post and makes the perfect novelty gift, or would look great dancing on your stereo, in your car or on the windowsill. He is 10.5cm tall x 5.5cm wide at the base. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Policeman Solar Powered Flip Flap.</p>

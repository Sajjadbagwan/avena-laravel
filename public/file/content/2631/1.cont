	These lustrous stones have often been mistaken for gold but are actually a type of iron mineral. Because of this, it is commonly known as &#39;fools&#39; gold&#39;. This resemblance has made it the symbol for money and good luck. The stones vary in each set and are packed in a small black pouch with the traditional pirate symbol printed on it. A good gift idea for kids who love to dress up as pirates or simply for someone who has been lacking in luck or wealth and would also make a cracking addition to an existing stone collection. &copy; Please do not copy text.

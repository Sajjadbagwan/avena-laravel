	This delightful Christmas ornament shows a cheerful, dancing snowman couple wearing brown and red tops and black boots, finished with cute little hats. The snowmen are fixed on top of the snow-like base which says &lsquo;Together no matter how big the drifts get&rsquo; making this the perfect gift idea for your loved one to say a little thank you for their loving support. It would also make a lovely gift idea for a couple who have been together for many many years, standing strongly by each other or just to treat yourself to bring something heart-felt and decorative into your home during the festive season. This charming snowman ornament would make the perfect Christmas decoration put on a shelf, on the mantelpiece or on the windowsill anywhere around the home. This wonderful snowman couple measures 10cm tall and 6.5cm wide.</p>

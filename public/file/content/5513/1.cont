The bells are attached to a large wire loop with the long strands of fabric dangling down for the bells. The loop can easily be hooked around door handles or even attached onto the door itself, so that&nbsp;a festive jingle is given off when anyone enters the room. It is an elegant and simple design that will make a great addition to any Christmas room in&nbsp;the house. The door hanger measures 25cm long.</span></p>

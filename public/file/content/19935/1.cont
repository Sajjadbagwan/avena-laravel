	Arnica (Heterotheca inuloides) is widely used as a homeopathic anti-inflammatory that may be ease traumatic injuries such as sprains and strains in the joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons and for backache. Arnica is probably best known as a pain relieving oil that could counteract inflammation, reduce swelling and discoloration on bruises, aiding healing and relieving pain.</p>
<p>
	When blood vessels are broken, blood escapes and comes to rest in the surrounding tissue, this trapped blood is responsible for black and blue bruise marks. Arnica may reduce these marks by enabling the body to reabsorb this trapped blood.</p>
<p>
	To use: dab onto affected areas (bruises or aching muscles) with cotton wool and massage in twice daily. Note: do not use on broken skin or take internally.<br />

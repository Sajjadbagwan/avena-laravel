	This luxurious Lavender Gift Box contains only lavender scented products including a novel scented soap sponge which gives a great way to lather up in the bath or shower; a delicate scented sachet together with a votive candle and a fantastic candle tin to fragrance your home; a gentle and moisturising soap along with a great bath blaster to fizz away in the bath; a tub of wonderful lavender flowers with a strong and long-lasting fragrance and a bottle of our gorgeous lavender essential oil to calm and balance the soul. All of these gorgeous products are lovingly hand packed into a plain card box with a sticker placed on the front which can be used to put to whom the gift set is for, or can be a place for a lovely message to the recipient. The cost of these products if purchased individually would be &pound;33.17 and as well as all the luxury contents, this Avena gift set also comes with a fantastic money off voucher for the recipient saving them 25% off their next online order, making the gift set complete and even better value! The description and image for each gift set is accurate when added to our website but should any item be out of stock we may replace this with a similar item so as not to delay delivery but we would only do this with an item of the same or higher value.</p>

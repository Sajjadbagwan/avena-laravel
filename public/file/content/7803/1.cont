	This festive word block is made in a rustic style, painted brown and decorated with Santa&rsquo;s belt and light brown snowflakes, then completed with a message reading &lsquo;Dear Santa&hellip; I really did try&rsquo;. This humorous Christmas word block would make a quirky gift idea or would be just as great to treat yourself to bring something humorous into your home during the festive season. This humorous word block would look fantastic together with our other &lsquo;Dear Santa&rsquo; word blocks or just on its own on a windowsill facing outside or would make a charming decoration put on a shelf or mantelpiece in any room throughout the home. This lovely word block measures 10cm long and 5cm high x 2.5cm wide.</p>

	Amethyst, with its rich purple colour, is one of the most popular gemstones and is often used to aid soothing, healing and cleansing. It is said to be a powerful aid to creative thinking and spiritual awareness and is also believed to help combat insomnia. Amethyst is the birthstone of Pisces (19th Feb - 20th March) and the symbol of peace. This gorgeous agogo pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.

	This dancing purple shark has a solar panel on the front of its base, which powers the dancing motion. His fins move up and down as his hips sway from side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get him dancing, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not made as toys and are not suitable for children under 36 months old due to small parts. Each shark comes in a clear cellophane bubble display. He is 10cm tall x 6.5cm wide. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description- Shark Solar Powered Flip Flap.</p>

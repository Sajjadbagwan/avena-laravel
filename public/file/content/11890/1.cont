	This wicked wrist piece implements the bulldog and barbed wire tattoo design printed onto a studded black leatherette bracelet; the pattern itself is made up of the portrait of a bulldog to the right coloured brown, with a band of barbed wire and textbook tattoo font reading &#39;Trust No-one&#39; placed on a white scroll. This accessory is worn on the wrist, giving the wearer an authentic punk-rock style. This is a great accessory for young and old alternative dressers, so whether you&#39;re rocking out a lot, or knocking on a bit, this accessory would be a great addition to your wardrobe. If this style isn&#39;t for you it parallels as a great gift idea for your alternative buddy. This bracelet measures at L23cm x W3.5cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

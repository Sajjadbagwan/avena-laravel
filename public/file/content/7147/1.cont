	Edward the Great Knight is full of character. He would make a great gift to add to any fantasy collection or can even be the start of a collection himself. Edward stands proud and fearless at 8cm tall and 5cm wide. He is wearing a complete body suit of metal armour with his helmet protecting his head and the back of his neck. He has a coloured strip in his right arm showing what side he is on. In his right hand he tightly holds a spear and in his left he grips his shield for protection. Edward is as ready as he ever will be for battle.&nbsp;</p>

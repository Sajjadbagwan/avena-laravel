	Henry Iron Fist Knight is full of character. He would make a great gift to add to any fantasy collection or can even be the start of a collection himself. Henry stands proud and fearless at 8cm tall and 4cm wide. He is wearing a full body of metal armour including a helmet. He is holding his sword with both hands and upright ready to strike if needed. His is leaning forward on his left leg so is prepared for any on-comers. You can see Henry&#39;s eyes through his helmet and he has a very focused look in his eyes like he knows exactly what he has to do.</p>

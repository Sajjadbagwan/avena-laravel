	This stunning small, round one-hooped traditional dream catcher is decorated with black beads and black and orange feathers, making the dream the ideal decoration at Halloween. Smaller dream catchers such as this are ideal for travel or taking on holiday and are often hung in cars, trucks and caravans etc. This lovely dream catcher measures approximately 22cm long from the hook to the bottom feather. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Dream catchers are very popular with children suffering bad dreams. &copy; Please do not copy text.

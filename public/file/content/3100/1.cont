<p>These dragon candle holders are made from resin and have been finished in a great style and fantastic detail with cross hatching details on the wings the colours subtlety blend into each other. The dragon is holding a flat bowl in one claw which can be used to display a tea light or votive candle and comes with one white tea light included. Each dragon is carefully packed in a box making a great gift idea. Dimensions 19cm tall.</p>

	<strong>In 1979, musician and instrument designer Garry Kvistad founded Woodstock Percussion with a single great idea - to make the world&#39;s best sounding wind chime. He&#39;s been creating his world-famous, musically-tuned Woodstock Chimes ever since.&nbsp; These chimes are designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance. They&#39;re hand-tuned to a universal, pentatonic (five-note) scale and act in concert with the wind to create random patterns of wonderful sound.<br />

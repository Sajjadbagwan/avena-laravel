	This charming little rabbit is made out of resin, therefore it is frost and water resistant would make a lovely element, nestled between flowers in the garden as well as inside the house next to a plant pot or towards a collection. With it being beautifully coloured its detailed design and the twinkle in his eyes makes this cute bunny more realistic. This delightful rabbit is brown with a white tummy and is lying down with his ears dropped at the back. The rabbit is approx. 17cm long and 11cm tall. This irresistible little bunny makes a perfect gift for someone who loves nature`s little creatures.</p>

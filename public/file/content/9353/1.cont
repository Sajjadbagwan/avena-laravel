	This stunning dream catcher has an image of three wolves standing on the snowy ground with one of the wolves howling at the wintery moon in the blue sky. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams and these wolf designs are our best sellers. This dream catcher is approximately 40cm long from the hook to the bottom feather. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Three Wolves &amp; Moon Dream Catcher Small.</p>

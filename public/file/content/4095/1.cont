	This amethyst pendulum is a beautiful piece, with the round amethyst weight at the bottom connected to a delicate silver chain. Amethyst with its rich purple colour is one of our most popular gemstones. It&rsquo;s a powerful aid to creative thinking, spiritual awareness and healing which is also said to combat insomnia. Crystals or healing gemstones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your wellbeing.&nbsp;The pendulum itself is used usually for spiritual guidance and healing, and sometime for inner growth. This a lovely spiritual gift for someone or even if you wanting to treat yourself.</p>

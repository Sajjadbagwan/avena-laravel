	Goniatites are shelled cephalopods related to the squid and octopus family. They became extinct at the end of the Permian some 251.4 million years ago. Goniatites should not be confused with their more famous descendants, ammonites, which lived 200 million years after them. These beautiful double polished Goniatite fossils measure approximately L6cm x W4.5cm but as they are genuine natural fossils they can vary in size and pattern. We keep a few in stock in our shop and cherry pick the best for online orders so you are always assured of a lovely piece. &copy; Please do not copy text.

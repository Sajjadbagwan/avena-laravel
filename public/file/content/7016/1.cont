	This mini smudge stick is 11cm long and made from white sage. It has been bound together using 100% cotton and dried, ready to burn. This sacred herb has been used for centuries by Native Americans.&nbsp; Smudge sticks are known for their use in rituals or ceremonies to cleanse people, objects and places of negative energy. It is said that cleansing your house should be undertaken a couple of times a year, to clear away negative energy that may have arrived. To use your smudge stick: light the tip and the blow it out (like you would an incense stick). Surround your body, the objects or a certain place you would like to cleanse with the smoke. Traditionally the ash is caught in a shell as this is also an ideal place to place an extinguished smudge stick. If you do not have a shell, a bowl would be fine to hold underneath instead. To extinguish the stick smother the end (like you would a cigarette) but please be aware that the stick may continue to burn, so double check once smothered.</p>

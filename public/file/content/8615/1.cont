	This fantastic pirate chest was found by the crew of the famous pirate ship, the Jolly Roger and was buried by the feared Captain Hook so no one can get to his treasure. Luckily we have found it, and discovered that this marvellous chest is full of gemstones. Crystals or healing gemstones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. This brilliant treasure chest would make the perfect gift idea for children who are into their pirate stuff and would make a great addition to an existing pirate collection. The chest also contains a map so that children can find out where their treasure came from; and a small black pouch which is the perfect size to store the pirate&rsquo;s gold in. This wonderful pirate chest measures 6.5cm tall, 7x7.5cm wide and comes packaged in a colourful gift box. &copy; Please do not copy text.

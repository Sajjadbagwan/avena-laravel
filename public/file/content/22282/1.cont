	These ear candles are made with fabric and coated in beeswax with quality essential oils added to create a beautiful and relaxing aroma whilst these candles are being used. Lavender essential oil is known as a very good relaxing oil and is great for the skin. Ear candles create a vacuum in the ear canal. The heat produced from the candle helps to draw out excess ear wax and other debris which may be present in the ear canal. Benefits of ear candling include relieving tinnitus (ringing in the ears), helping to relieve sinus pain and pressure, removing excess wax build up, assisting with relieving &#39;swimmers&#39; ear&#39;, assisting with headaches, relieving severely itchy ears (often caused by yeast, mould or dairy allergies) and helping to unplug ears (often due to illness). Other potential benefits may include improved lymphatic fluid flow through the body, improved colour perception, a more balanced emotional state and clearer thinking. It has also been reported that those who partake in ear candling experience an improved sense of taste as well as reduced pressure, which may be present in the ears due to a wax build up or infection. &copy; Please do not copy text.

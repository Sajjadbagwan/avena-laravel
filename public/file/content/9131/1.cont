	A fantastic selection of six fragrance oils is a must have collection for those who love fruity fragrances. These lovely oils are stored in our dark wood design wooden oil box which is an essential tool when keeping or transporting your oils because it protects them from light when not in use and prolongs their freshness. Each fruity fragrance oil gift box contains a 10ml bottle each of blackberry, cherry, cranberry, grapefruit &amp; kiwi, summer fruits and orange plus the vintage looking wooden storage box. If purchased separately this set would cost &pound;24.93 - our fruity oils offer is all these oils and the box for only &pound;19.99!</p>

	The description and image for each gift set is accurate when added to our website but should any item be out of stock we may replace this with a similar item and the boxes can alternate between the two images as they are proving hard to get hold of. This would mean there&#39;s no delay to delivery but we would only do this with an item of the same or higher value. &copy; Please do not copy text.

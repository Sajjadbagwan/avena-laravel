	These wonderful owl sun-catchers that make a string of five&nbsp;are ideal to hang in any window to truly show off the colours and catch the light but also look great on a wall or simply hung loose as a mobile. This piece is 800mm tall from the metal hanger to the lowest coloured ball. This sun-catcher mobile is great quality and is hand made on the island of Bali. Ethically traded: our supplier of this product is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. This finds its practical application in&nbsp;their dealings with their suppliers, customers and the environment. They give all their overseas suppliers a fair price, build real&nbsp;and lasting connections with them, monitor fair wages&nbsp;and good working conditions, minimise any environmental impact and use some of their profits to benefit the communities in which these products are made. An example of just one project is that they donated &pound;5000 to rebuild Gejiadeng Primary School, a very old mountain school in Yunnan, which was in a dangerous state of disrepair. Building work on the school was completed in March 2008 providing the children with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a safe happy environment.</p>

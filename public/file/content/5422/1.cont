	This stunning looking sphere is made from dalmatian jasper. Jasper is said to be an extremely nurturing stone and works in a subtle way to give slow and gentle healing. It is also a protective stone, protecting against depression and negative thinking. In addition, jasper is said to encourage a determination to succeed and to see ideas through into action. Dalmatian jasper is also classed as brown jasper and therefore has a few extra properties. These include reducing environmental stress, being a very grounding stone and also imparting calm and tranquility. This highly polished sphere is approximately 45mm and sits perfectly on our egg stands making it great for a display, it will also make a lovely gift when given in one of our pouches. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

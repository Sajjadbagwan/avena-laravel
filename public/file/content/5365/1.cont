	This simply stunning design by Lisa Parker is of the Spell Keeper Owl sat on a crystal ball with a Pentagram. With the night sky and leafless branches showing through the window behind the owl it creates an airy and mystical greeting card which is blank inside for your own message and comes with a white envelope. The card is approximately 13 cm by 13 cm.</p>

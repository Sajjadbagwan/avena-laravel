	Sulphur is also known as nature&rsquo;s healing and beauty mineral and it is the key ingredient in this fantastic cream. The reduction of sulphur in our bodies with age causes wrinkles, fine lines and age spots. It is possible to defy this process by using sulphur based products. These encourage the skin to shed the dead skin cells that cause blocked pores, which in turn lead to skin problems like acne. Sulphur is an effective natural antiseptic and antibacterial treatment suitable for all skin and especially suited to many skin conditions. This natural sulphur cream is lightly whipped using a blend of lemongrass, lavender, rosemary and carrot pure essential oils with added Vitamin E. The natural replenishment properties of this amazing cream include being useful for eczema, acne, rosacea, psoriasis and other skin problems such as sunburn and insect bites. &copy; Please do not copy text.

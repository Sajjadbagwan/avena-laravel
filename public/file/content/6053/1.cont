	Cinnamon &ndash; it&rsquo;s not just for Christmas. It has been traditionally used through the ages as a cure for numerous health and wellbeing issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In its raw form, Cinnamon is simply the bark of a tree which has been coppiced. This allows shoots to appear, which are then harvested as the cinnamon sticks we all know. Ancient sources suggest that it was imported from Egypt in the year 2000BC, and was an expensive luxury. That was a long time, and the prices have come down significantly!</p>
<p>
	You can use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Cinnamon-Essential-Oil-Cinnamomum-Zeylanicum/">Cinnamon Essential Oil</a>, for a variety of different reasons and make the most of it&#39;s benefits. It is great for easing the symptoms of a cold or flu; Cinnamon&rsquo;s warming scent soothes aches, pains and blocked sinuses, leaving your head clear and free of that unpleasant stuffy feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Cinnamon essential oil can be used as an anti-nausea treatment. Inhaling the scent of cinnamon can relieve the symptoms of nausea. It can also be used for any kind of motion nausea, such as travel sickness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This particular essential oil has a warming, relaxing aroma that calms the mind. Its heavy scent allows you to concentrate and block out the modern world. This makes it an excellent addition to massage mixtures when mixed with a moisturising base.</p>
<p>
	Cinnamon is a mild antiseptic. It was prevalent in the trenches of WW1, and is still used in the developing world today. Its properties destroy bacteria, it is potent, and should therefore be used sparingly.</p>

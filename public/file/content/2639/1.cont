	Empty plastic bottles in blue with a pipette type screw on cap which has a natural rubber bulb and glass tube that is ideal for dispensing oils more accurately. The colour of the plastic bottle protects the contents from light damage, keeps them fresh and prolongs the shelf life. Plastic bottles are ideal for carrier oils, fragrance oils, bath oils, beauty products, massage oils, shampoos and other bathroom products as they are less likely to break than glass. Plastic bottles are also a lot lighter than glass making them ideal to transport, ship or mail out liquids.</p>

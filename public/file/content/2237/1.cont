These hand rolled incense sticks are made using traditional and only natural ingredients handed down through generations. The exotic perfume is made up of herbs and spices, resins and natural essential oils, blended with Indian perfumes to deliver a truly delicate fragrance. Choose between one box which&nbsp;contains 16g of incense (approx 16 sticks) or 12 boxes which contain approx. 192 sticks.</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px">This amazing looking wine/spirits gargoyle guardian is a fantastic feature for anyone who likes a bottle of wine or spirits hanging around the house. It would look fantastic in any room and will definitely deter anyone from stealing that special bottle of something. The guardian is made from black resin and is standing tall&nbsp;on his clawed feet, looking&nbsp;fierce and very protective. He has large wings on his back with a single spike on the top of them both. He has two small horns on his head and his ears are back due to his angry mood, his arms are up at shoulder height around the front ready to grab anyone or anything that comes near his property. This guardian has an extremely fierce facial expression, with piercing eyes and his mouth wide open showing off his teeth and large fangs like he is letting out a big roar. He is standing on a large rock base with skulls around the front - maybe the skulls of those who have tried to take his possession in the past? This gargoyle guardian is 45cm tall and 21cm wide. It is suitable for a range of bottles including spirits and wines and even some glasses. Please be aware that bottles and glasses etc. are not included.</span></p>

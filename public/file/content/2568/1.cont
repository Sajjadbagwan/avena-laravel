	Tutankhamun lived over 3,300 years ago. He was a young boy of approximately nine years when he ascended the throne of Egypt and he married a slightly older Ankhesenpaaten (one of the daughters of Akhenaten and Nefertiti). Sometime around the ninth year of Tutankhamun&#39;s reign, possibly 1325 B.C. he died. There is evidence of an injury to the skull that had time to partly heal. He may have suffered an accident, such as falling from his horse-drawn chariot, or perhaps he was murdered, to this day no one knows for sure. Tutankhamun&#39;s burial arrangements lasted for&nbsp;70 days and he remained at rest in Egypt&#39;s Valley of the Kings for over 3,300 years. In&nbsp;November 1922 Tutankhamun&#39;s tomb was discovered by the British Egyptologist Howard Carter and then only by fortune as the tomb almost escaped discovery and could still have&nbsp;lain undiscovered to this day. Carter had been searching for the tomb for a number of years and his patron Lord Carnarvon had decided that enough time and money had been expended with little return. However, Carter managed to persuade his patron to fund one more season and within days of resuming his search&nbsp;the tomb was found. This oil burner has circle of three Tutankhamun figures shaped so that the glass burning dish is held in place by resting on each head. In a beautiful gold finish it comes with tea light included, stands 12cm high (15cm wide) and is&nbsp;individually well packed.</p>

	What a fantastic idea! These luxurious soap bundles contain three or more slices&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Heyland &amp; Whittle classic soap ranges, tied together and decorated. Every one is slightly different and will fill your home with a luxurious and unique fragrance. They are ideal to use as a room, drawer or wardrobe fragrance and after this or when you can wait no longer, use them as a luxury soap, after all that&#39;s what they are! They sell very well as wedding favours and for use in hampers etc. All of the soaps are handmade in England using the finest natural ingredients and are all sulphate and paraben free. Colours of the soaps may vary slightly from the image shown due to the natural ingredients used.</p>

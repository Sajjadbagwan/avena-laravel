	Blocked up? Blended with pure essential oils (not watered down or blended with any carrier oil) for a full strength burning oil. Place five drops of Easy Breathe in an oil burner and top up with water, then burn in the room for relief from blocked up cold and flu symptoms and a pleasant clearing aroma. Alternatively at night or for children place five drops onto a damp clean cloth and then drape the cloth on a radiator in the room or bedroom at night. The heat from the radiator acts as candle would vaporising the oil into the room without the worry of a burning candle or water level in a burner.</p>

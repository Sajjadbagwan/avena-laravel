	This stunning fairy ornament is made with a lot of attention to detail and coloured grey with a hint of verdigris giving it a vintage look. This fantastic ornament is made from quality polyresin making it ideal to place anywhere in the garden inbetween flowers, in or next to larger plant pots, on stone walls etc. This garden fairy ornament would also make a lovely decoration indoors, placed on the windowsill, mantelpiece, shelf etc. This decorative fairy is frost resistant and winter should not be an issue but to prolong the appearance she can move indoors for the harsher months. The fairy is treated for protection from the sun&rsquo;s UV rays but all ornaments like this can deteriorate slightly over time so to keep it in top condition a lacquer or varnish may be a good idea to apply at the beginning of Spring if required. This stunning fairy holding a snail would make the ideal gift idea for someone who is a lover of garden ornaments and would make the perfect addition to an existing fairy collection. This large fairy ornament measures H31cm x W10cm x L8cm. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Fairy Standing with Snail.</p>

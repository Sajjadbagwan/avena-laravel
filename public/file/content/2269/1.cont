	A great quality hematite Buddha. Buddha is the ultimate symbol of happiness, wealth and good fortune. Buddha&#39;s belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity and by stroking it, it is believed to bring much good luck. The laughing Buddha must always be invited into his new home, resulting in positive Chi and bringing great happiness. Always place your Buddha in a position of honour and never on the floor. He can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office but avoid bathrooms and toilets. Hematite is said to have strengthening and soothing properties and is created from oxidized iron. Its crystal healing properties are rooted in the fortifying energy of iron, and the calming, sustaining nature of oxygen and it is renowned for aiding mental and spiritual well being. Buddha is 50mm tall and 50mm wide. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

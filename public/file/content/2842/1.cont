	A wonderful gift pack containing chunks of our finest handmade soaps. All made with essential oils and suitable for vegans, the chunks are all different shapes, sizes and colours, weighing 300g and packed in a&nbsp;lovely recycled gift pack. Directions for use - our soaps can be used like any normal bar of soap but they are much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with. Alternatively, rub the bar on a sponge. These soap chunks are also ideal to add to gift baskets .&nbsp;</p>

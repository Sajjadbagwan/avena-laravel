	Henna paste is used for body art and has been used to adorn young women&#39;s bodies as part of social and holiday celebrations since the late Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean. The practice originates from the Indian sub-continent but is now practiced all over the world. This fantastic henna paste product is imported from India.

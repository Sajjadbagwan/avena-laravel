	This lovely looking pixie figurine is called &lsquo;Fergus.&rsquo; He is leaning on a large mushroom looking like he&#39;s watching the world pass him by. He has a friendly expression on his face that also makes him look a little bit cheeky. This pixie has brilliant details from the folds in the clothing to the stitching pattern and the facial features. The main colours on the figurine are shades of red, green and brown. This pixie stands at approximately 19cm tall and 9cm wide and would be a lovely feature to add to any home.</p>

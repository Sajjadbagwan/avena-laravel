	Willpower is an effective tool to create change but there are scenarios when it might not be the right tool. For example, somebody suffering with stress or anxiety might not be able &lsquo;to snap out of it&rsquo; simply by focusing their mind on overcoming the problem. Harnessing the power of the subconscious could be one way to make progress in such an instance and hypnotherapy is a tool that enables this process. Instead of creating change by conscious intervention, hypnotherapy works on a subconscious level. A hypnotherapy practitioner will typically use a technique such as guided visualisation to induce a deep inner relaxation in his or her listener. This state of peace and relaxation may itself be therapeutic. Also whilst in this state, the listener&rsquo;s subconscious mind is open to absorbing new and helpful patterns of thinking. Such benefits mean that hypnotherapy can have value within the treatment of conditions such as stress, anxiety and sleep disorders.</p>

	&lsquo;Creating Inner Peace and Calm&rsquo; is an audio resource that provides an alternative to working on a one-to-one basis with a hypnotherapist. The CD contains two 27-minute sessions in which hypnotherapist Glenn Harrold helps the listener to enter into profound relaxation. Glenn&rsquo;s voiceover and subliminal suggestions are intended to induce a peaceful inner state. In addition, the acoustic sound design of the recording uses effects such as echo and stereo panning to create further a mood of relaxation and peace. CD creator and hypnotherapist Glenn Harrold has practiced hypnotherapy for 20 years and is a Fellow of The British School of Clinical Hypnosis.</p>

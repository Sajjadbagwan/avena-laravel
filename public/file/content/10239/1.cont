	The festivities are brewing on Candy Cane Lane where bells are ringing and choirs are singing; where pure essential oils of peppermint and bergamot heighten the excitement as the naturals butter nourish your skin. To use, simply drop your bath blaster into a bath of warm water and watch as it fizzes, releasing its perfume and essential oils. Your bath blaster can be used more than once and is suitable for vegans. Rinse bath well after use.

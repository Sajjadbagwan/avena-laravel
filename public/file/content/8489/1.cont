	These fantastic looking hematite rune stones are of excellent quality and come in a zip pouch with an information card. Hematite is said to enhance personal magnetism, will and courage. It is also said to be beneficial for blood flow, relieving stress and relaxing the nerves. Crystals or healing gemstones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Runes are thought by some to be a way of interacting with both the spirit and the living world. The system of premonition by runes can be credited to two tribes who came together and produced a combination of symbols and old signs which were found on a variety of paintings, ritual and domestic items in the North from as early as Paleolithic times. There are, however, other myths surrounding the origins of the runes including the Volsungr, a Northern ancestral tribe who crossed into Europe before the Ice Age. Today the use of the runes seems to be enjoying a modern day revival with collections becoming widely available. They are great to collect or to give as a gift. &copy; Please do not copy text.

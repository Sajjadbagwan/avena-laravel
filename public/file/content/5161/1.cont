	Take a trip with me to Violet Hill, a place where the lemonade springs and the bluebirds sing! With a pure cocoa and shea butter piping inside to leave your skin silky smooth and nourished, it has pure lavender and rose essential oils. This exotic, sweet scent opens with heady top notes of violet leaves&nbsp;and rosebuds, leading to a heart of violets, roses, lilacs and mimosa. The powdery, delicate base blends cedarwood and purple irises. This Violet Hill bath blaster comes individually wrapped in cellophane making it an ideal gift. To use simply place your whoopie blaster in warm water and watch as it fizzes, rapidly releasing its fragrance and essential oils. When a portion has dissolved simply remove the rest from the bath as each bath blaster can be used up to four times. Please rinse petals or decorations away from the bath immediately after use to prevent accidental staining.

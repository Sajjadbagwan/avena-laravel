	This lovely looking hanging beany owl is a great decoration to add to your Christmas tree. The owl has a brown furry body with a knitted beige belly&nbsp;and beaded googly eyes. The owl is wearing a lovely patterned winter hat with a tinselled bobble at the end. The owls can also be hung around the house as decorations as&nbsp;they do not weigh too much. Why not see what it looks like hung from a door or a window? The owls measure 19cm long (including hanging loop).</p>

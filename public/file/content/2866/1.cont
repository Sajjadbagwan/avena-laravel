	St. John&#39;s Wort infused oil is a universal carrier oil often used by aromatherapists when preparing massage blends and creams. It is widely used for bruises, sprains and aching muscles due to is anti-inflammatory properties, and is often used by herbalists to help speed the healing of wounds and sores, skin irritations and burns.</p>

	St. John&#39;s Wort is not a new herbal treatment, but one that has been handed down for hundreds of years. Once known to pharmacists as red oil or Hypericum liniment, it was still available in pharmacies in the early 20th century. The practice of soaking the flowers in olive oil, infusing the oil in the sun and then using the oil internally as a diuretic or externally as an application for wounds dates at least to the time of the first edition of Gerarde&#39;s Herball from 1597. Such is the success of the oil the German government allows St. John&#39;s Wort preparations to be labelled for the treatment (or after treatment) of such conditions as sharp or abrasive wounds, muscular pain as well as first degree burns.</p>

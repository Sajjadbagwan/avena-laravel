	<span style="font-size: 12px">Each charming Flip Flap is made from bright colourful plastic. On the front there is a solar panel which powers the flip flap motion. The leaves move up and down and the central stem with a sheep on it moves from side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light make the Flip Flaps move, but to really get them flapping they like strong direct sunlight. These items are not toys, and are not suitable for children under&nbsp;</span>36 months<span style="font-size: 12px">&nbsp;old due to small parts. Each Flip Flap comes in a clear cellophane bubble display. Please note the colour of each base will vary from the photograph. At certain times due to low or uneven stock, not all colours may be available.</span></p>

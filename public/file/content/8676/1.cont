	This delightful resin ornament is a miniature version of Noah&rsquo;s ark with Noah himself on board. He has a long beard and he is holding his arms up to the air, one of which he is holding his walking stick in. He is standing amongst a pair of lions, elephants, giraffes, monkeys and llamas and many more species that are hiding inside the boat. The boat itself is coloured brownish and the rest of the ornament, including Noah, the animals and the sail, is coloured cream. This wonderful piece would make a lovely gift idea for someone who is a lover of Noah&rsquo;s story of starting over and would make a charming decoration placed anywhere in the home. This decorative ornament measures 9.5cm tall and 9x6cm wide. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Noah&rsquo;s Ark.</p>

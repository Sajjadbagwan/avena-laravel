	A beautiful mirrored fairy motif on a cascade of crystals with complementary beads and finished with a 38mm Swarovski&reg; spectra icicle rainbow maker crystal. On a good quality silver metal chain every crystal has a hangtag with an individual description and sentiment relevant to each design. This piece measures 22.5cm from the top hook to the bottom of the crystal. The actual Swarovski&reg; rainbow maker crystal measures 4cm x 1cm so is a very generous size and hung in a sunlit window will make the most beautiful and mesmerising dancing rainbow display although they are so lovely they can be hung anywhere and make ideal gifts for many occasions such as Christenings, Mothers&#39; Day, house warming, birthdays, Valentine&#39;s etc. Designed and handmade in the UK they really are a beautiful and heart-warming gift. &copy; Please do not copy text.

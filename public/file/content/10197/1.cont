Please note that our gemstone hearts may slightly vary from the picture shown as these are natural stone products and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of each item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

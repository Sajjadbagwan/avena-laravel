	A beautiful Red Sitting Buddha statue with his hands lying on his knees, laughing. There is a quote from Buddha, saying: Each morning we are born again. What we do today is what matters most.&#39; Buddha was born around 565 B.C. in Lumbini, Northern India&nbsp;which in modern day is Nepal.&nbsp; Buddha translates to &#39;awakened one&#39; and he is a very highly regarded&nbsp;and respected figure.&nbsp; This wonderful quality and sturdy&nbsp;Buddha&nbsp;does him great&nbsp;justice, he is sat in a&nbsp;traditional pose of&nbsp;cross legged and is holding an ingot and wearing Mala beads.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddha&#39;&#39;s should be carefully placed in the home&nbsp;in order to mark respect for this honourable&nbsp;teacher.&nbsp; To obtain the best of your Buddha&#39;&#39;s philosophy of wakening to reality, he can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office etc. but avoid bathrooms,&nbsp;toilets and the floor.&nbsp;This wonderful Buddha ornament is approx. 17cm tall and 11x17cm wide. Would make the perfect gift towards a collection or just to someone wealth and happiness.&nbsp;</p>

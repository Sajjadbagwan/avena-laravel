	A fantastic dragon mobile and chime. The proud dragon suncatcher is made from metal, glass marbles and resin with wind chimes below and more coloured glass balls. The subtle chimes sound lovely as the breeze passes through them, the soothing tones seem to have a calming effect on the senses and are thought by some to relieve stress and worry. This chime is hand made in China and is imported by a company supporting education projects in rural China. It is fantastic quality, is ideal for indoor or outdoor use and would make a wonderful gift. The dragon chime measures 83cm long and 18cm wide at the widest point. Ethically traded: our supplier of this product is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. This finds its practical application in our dealings with their suppliers, customers and the environment. They give all their overseas suppliers a fair price, build real and lasting connections with them, monitor fair wages and good working conditions, minimise any environmental impact and use some of their profits to benefit the communities in which these products are made. An example of just one project is they donated &pound;5000 to rebuild Gejiadeng Primary School, a very old mountain school in Yunnan, which was in a dangerous state of disrepair. Building work on the school was completed in March 2008 providing the children with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a safe happy environment.</p>

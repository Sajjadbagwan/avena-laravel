	This fantastic teak root three-bowl is hand carved using the natural shape of the teak root for that unique and abstract shape, therefore each product is a uniquely beautiful work of natural art. This lovely piece would make the perfect stand alone, eye catching display or can be used as a functional display device such as a fruit bowl or to hold jewellery etc. Teak trees fell many years ago and instead of burning their roots, someone said &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t we make something interesting and useful out of them?&rsquo; and that is how a new industry was born producing carved teak root furniture. All our teak root bowls are hand-carved meaning the pattern and shade may vary slightly from bowl to bowl and differ from the image shown. This lovely teak root pyramid bowl is approximately 37cm long, is 12.5cm wide at the widest points and is 10.5cm tall and tallest point. &copy; Please do not copy text.

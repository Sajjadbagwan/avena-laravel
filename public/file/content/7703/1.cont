	This festive wooden plaque shows a cheerful snowman family wearing scarves and festive black hats, all decorated differently to each other, in a wintery scene of pine trees and snow. The black wire makes it ideal to be hung to doors, windows, mantelpiece of even a wall. This charming hanger is finished with a little red bell attached to the wire and words reading &lsquo;Christmas waves a magic wand over this beautiful world and behold, everything is kinder, gentler and more beautiful&rsquo;. This fantastic Christmas plaque would make the perfect Secret Santa gift or would be great hung on a larger present as a gift tag for that extra special touch. Why not treat yourself to one of our Christmas plaques during the festive season to bring something decorative into your own home? This lovely wooden hanger measures 15.5cm tall and 9.5cm wide.</p>

All our hearts are of a fantastic quality, rich in colour and polished to a smooth finish. This white howlite gemstone heart is approximately 4cm tall x 4cm wide and comes in a small pouch. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we will be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

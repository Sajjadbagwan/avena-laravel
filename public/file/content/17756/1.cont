	This funky metal ornament is light in weight, crafted to resemble a cute little bunny rabbit with wide spread feet and large comical ears protruding over it&#39;s head. It&#39;s face is decorated with large shining eyes with pink iris&#39; and a little smile with large black whiskers and a pink button nose. It&#39;s head sits on a small rigid spring, giving the sheep a wobbling effect when moved. With it&#39;s unique look and fantastic design, this ornament would look great sat in the garden, adding character to the open space. Ideal as a gift for keen garden enthusiasts this sheep measures at H22cm x L14cm and is part of our 3 for &pound;19.99 offer (which can be mixed and matched with other items on this offer). &copy; Please do not copy text.

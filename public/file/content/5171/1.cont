	This elegant fairy is Mable. She is hand painted with a range of beautiful colours and tremendous detail from the locks of hair to the ties on her dress. She is made from quality resin with elegant butterfly wings. Mable is resting on toadstools surrounded by daisies on a rock base. She would be a beautiful fairy to add to any collection or to give as a gift. Mable is 12cm tall x 6cm wide and comes carefully packed in a lovely picture box.&nbsp;</p>

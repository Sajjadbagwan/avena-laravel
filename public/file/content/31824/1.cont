	Amethyst, with its rich purple colour, is one of our most popular gemstones. It&rsquo;s said to be a powerful aid to creative thinking, spiritual awareness and healing and is also said to combat insomnia.<br />
	This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery, but we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of the item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. The average size for each tumblestone is approximately 2cm long.<br />

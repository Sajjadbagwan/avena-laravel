	These wonderfully unique stones are already proving to be a big hit in our shop. Made for the outdoors they can withstand the elements and are frost resistant but are just as happy indoors looking great on any shelf, desk, fireplace or getting interesting looks if placed on a windowsill spying at people through the window! They can also be used as a door stop, paperweight etc. and make a great comical gift. They are made from quality resin and have a granite type finish to them; they are solid, sturdy and quite heavy. Set in the centre of the &lsquo;Cyclops&rsquo; stone is a very realistic looking eye. The eye then has a metal zip attached around it. Why? We have no idea but love them or hate them they are selling fast. They are solid, durable and great quality making a fantastic and different gift idea and they now come in a fab gift box. These stones measure approximately H12cm x W11cm. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Eye Stone with Zip Grey.</p>

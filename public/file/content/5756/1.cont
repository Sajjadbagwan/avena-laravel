	The fantastic skiing Santa and snowman ornament will look wonderful displayed in any home over the festive period. The Santa has skis attached to his feet, one of which is on wheels. There is a snowman sitting on his back holding onto Santa&rsquo;s scarf while they ride around delivering presents. At the back of one of the skis there are presents and a teddy bear that are waiting to be delivered to lucky children. The skis have a sign that looks like it is blowing in the wind as they ride, with the words &lsquo;Santa Racer&rsquo; written on it. This colourful ornament measures 16cm long, 15cm tall and 5cm wide.</p>

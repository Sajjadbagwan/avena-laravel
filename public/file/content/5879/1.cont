	We all know that Christmas can be a time of great joy - and also great stress too. Not only do we worry about the inevitable family tensions, getting the turkey just right and separating squabbling siblings, but we tend to worry about getting the perfect gifts, too. We all want our loved ones to be happy with the gifts we buy for them although sometimes it can be a difficult task getting it just right.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	This is where Avena can help. We have huge range of scented <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/essential-oils/">oils</a>, fragranced sachets and incense cones which can be a good idea for stocking fillers. Everyone loves the idea of lighting a fragrant <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/candles/">candle</a>, redolent with cinnamon, vanilla or clove, at the end of a hectic day. Sinking into a warm bath and dropping in a <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/bath-products/bath-treats/">bath treat</a> such as one of our <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/candy-bath-blaster/">bath blasters</a> while burning a few candles is just heavenly.<br />
	<br />
	Candles and bath bombs are great, but don&#39;t last for ever, so if it&#39;s a lasting gift you&#39;re after, Avena can help. Choose from a range of oil burners, like the <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Moon-Stars-Oil-Burner-With-Green-Crackle-Glaze/">moon and stars burner</a>, with crackled green glaze, or select the healing, calming protection stones, including <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Amethyst-Gemstone/">amethyst</a> and <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Red-Jasper-Heart-Large/">red jasper</a>.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Of course winter presents us with the challenges of cold weather, so Avena&#39;s range of <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/microwavable-gifts/">microwavable slippers</a>, boots and hot packs, scented with lavender, is just the best way to round off a day off cooking, travelling and serious diplomacy!</div>

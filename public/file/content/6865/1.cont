	This adorable bright yellow duck is powered by a solar panel on the front that starts the duck&#39;s dancing motion. His body dances from side to side which then makes his head bobble too. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get him dancing, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not made as toys and are not suitable for children under 36 months&nbsp;of age&nbsp;due to small parts. Each duck comes in a clear cellophane bubble display. He is 10cm tall x 6cm wide.</p>

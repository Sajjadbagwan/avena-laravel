	Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) also known as common artemisia, felon herb, St. John&#39;s herb, chrysanthemum weed, sailor&#39;s tobacco, and moxa is a perennial member of the Compositae family and a close relative of wormwood. Mugwort&#39;s generic name is from that of the Greek moon goddess Artemis, a patron of women. Mugwort has long been considered as a&nbsp;herbal ally for women with particular benefit in regulating the menstrual cycle and easing the transition to menopause. The common name may be from the old English word &#39;moughte&#39; meaning &#39;moth&#39; or &#39;mucgwyrt&#39; meaning &#39;midgewort&#39;, referring to the plant&#39;s folk use&nbsp;for repelling moths and other insects. Mugwort has a long history of folk tradition and use. Anglo-Saxon tribes believed that the aromatic mugwort was one of the nine sacred herbs given to the world by the god Woden. It was used as a flavouring additive to beer before hops became widely used. Mugwort is considered a magical herb, with special properties to protect road-weary travellers against exhaustion. The Romans planted mugwort by roadsides where it would be available to put in shoes to relieve aching feet. Some of the magic in mugwort is in its reputed ability to induce prophetic and vivid dreams when the herb is placed near the bed or under the sleeper&#39;s pillow. Mugwort added to bath water is an aromatic and soothing treatment for the relief of aches in the muscles and joints. In a clinical trial, crushed fresh mugwort leaves applied to the skin were shown to be effective in eradicating warts. Supplied in a large jar for decorative storage or to make ideal gift.

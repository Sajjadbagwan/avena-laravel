	Agate was formed millions of years ago when hardened volcanic lava bubbles filled with enriched groundwater and created the wonderful patterns and colours. Agate can be cut and polished into many different shapes and sizes and these spectacular agate geodes are fantastic examples of the form. Each geode measures approximately 7cm tall. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell, so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

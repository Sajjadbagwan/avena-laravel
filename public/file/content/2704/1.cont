	This Ashleigh &amp; Burwood reed diffuser is a great natural way to fill your home with a scent you love. For those who don&#39;t like burning incense, or who prefer to be more eco friendly than using plug-in room fresheners, a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting&nbsp;and stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. With normal use the liquid will last up to 4 months! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and sit back whilst the fragrance is absorbed through the stick and evaporates across your room. This delightful heady fragrance captures the sultry atmosphere of the East. It contains sandalwood, amber and almond to create a fragrance&nbsp;that illuminates the senses, whilst sweet vanilla, musk and fig gently soften the powerful woody scent.</p>

	This charming cushion is made with brown polkadot fabric around the edge and other various colours of fabric on a pink and brown polkadot base. The cushion is decorated with a pink polkadot bow and brown letters in the centre reading &lsquo;My diet starts tomorrow&rsquo;. This lovely cushion is then stuffed with cotton wool to make it soft and fluffy for the extra loveliness. This cute cushion would make the perfect gift for someone who is a lover of chocolate or perhaps a friend (with a good humour) who is thriving to get to the gym but chocolate stands in the way. This decorative cushion would also be good just to treat yourself and bring some humour into your home and would look good put on a shelf, mantelpiece or windowsill in any room throughout the home including bedrooms, living rooms and hallways. The cushion measures 18cm long and 14cm wide.</p>

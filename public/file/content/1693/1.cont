	This beautiful Ashleigh &amp; Burwood Synergies square tealight gift set is a lovely gift for anyone. Essential oils in orange and lavender are blended together in these delightful candles to create a mood-enhancing aroma. These unique square tealights come presented in an attractive clear case and the candles come with a very pretty crystalline texture to the surface of the wax.&nbsp; The tealights are made from 100% palm oil wax, which is taken from managed&nbsp;and sustainable palm plantations. A much more environmentally sound choice to paraffin wax, they are also much cleaner and longer burning. Each gift pack contains&nbsp;three palm oil tealight candles with a ceramic holder. Each tealight square will burn for up to 5 hours.</p>

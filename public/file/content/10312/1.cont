	These hanging penguins are made of resin with a lot of attention detail from their little scarves and hats to the meaningful quotations wrote on each penguin&rsquo;s belly that read: &ldquo;Friendship never melts away&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tis the season to be freezin&rsquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Baby, it&rsquo;s cold outside&rdquo;. These lovely penguins are finished with black wire hangers making them ideal to be hung anywhere in the home on a door knob, window, wall or especially on the Christmas tree and they would also make the perfect accessory attached to wrapped presents instead of using traditional name tags. These decorative penguin hangers measure H7.5cm x W1cm x L5.5cm each. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Hanging Penguins Set of Three.</p>

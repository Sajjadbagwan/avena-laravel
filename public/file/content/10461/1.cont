	Set of ten rustic wooden assorted coloured pencils. Twig pencils are crafted from the natural tree branches of the Tamarind tree which is very common and prolific throughout SE Asia. The trees are farmed for their fruit and after the fruit is harvested, the branches are cut and left to dry in the sun. They are then drilled and the pencil colour is inserted. The pencil colour does not run the whole length of the pencil as this is not possible with this natural product.</p>

	The pack includes ten different colours which are bound together with an elastic band. This set of pencils would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of colouring or perhaps is an artist but would also make a lovely addition to any home used as decoration placed on a shelf, mantelpiece or desk.</p>

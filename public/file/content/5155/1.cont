	Take a fragrant journey back in time and wash away the years with the help of skin softening butters and healing tea tree essential oil. Close your eyes and feel young forever.&nbsp;Classical and pretty, this soft powdery scent captures jasmine, iris and spices at the opening. The rich heart mixes clove with amber, lily and peach and the complex musk finish captures sandalwood, amber and vanilla.&nbsp;Your bath tulip can be used up to four times by&nbsp;simply dropping it in the bath and allowing a portion to melt. Your bath tulip will fizz releasing the moisturising cocoa butter and softening the water. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your tulip to dissolve and remove the rest from the bath so it can be saved for later. Wash any petals away after use to prevent accidental staining of the bath. This bath tulip is suitable for vegans.See our full range of Bath Blasters, Cocoa Swirls, Bath Tulips, Whoopie Blasters and more by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/bath-products/bath-bombs-melts/">HERE.</a></p>

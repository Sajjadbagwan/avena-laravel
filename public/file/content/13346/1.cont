	Labradorite is said to aid many medical complaints from blood pressure and gout to colds and flu. Crystals or healing stones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your wellbeing. Does it work? Wear one, carry one with you, have them in your house or take one to bed to find out. All our stones are of a fantastic quality, rich in colour, smooth and polished. The average stone is 5-6cm long but as it is a natural stone product the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Labradorite Stone.</p>

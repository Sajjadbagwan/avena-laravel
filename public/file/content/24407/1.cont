<p>
	A stylish resin incense burner in a Tree Man design for backflow cones, so you can create impressive smoke displays in your own home.</p>
<p>
	It measures at 9cm tall and 7cm wide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Place your backflow cone on the top of the burner on the gold disc, and light the tip of the cone. After a while the smoke will flow downwards out of the Tree Man&#39;s mouth. For best results keep out of drafty areas.</p>

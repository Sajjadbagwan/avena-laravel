	Rose quartz is known as the &lsquo;love stone&rsquo; as it attracts love and supports the broken-hearted. It is said to aid peacefulness and calm in relationships and to ease stress and tension whilst also assisting sleep. Rose quartz is the birthstone of Taurus (21st April - 20th May) and the symbol of love. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our bracelets are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary from stone to stone and differ slightly from the image shown giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

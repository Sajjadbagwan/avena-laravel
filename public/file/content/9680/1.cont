	Gemstone wands have been used since ancient times to increase the power of spells. The pointed end of each wand directs the spell energy. Wands can be wrapped in silver or copper wire with other gemstones to personalise them for different uses. Wands are popular healing tools, used to channel energy in reflexology and massage. The stone should be chosen for its particular benefits and energies. Labradorite is very popular for its wonderful deep colours and varied patterns which make each piece unique.

	A stone of joy and mindful expansion, the Ocean Jasper crystal meaning is linked with its ability to encourage deep relaxation, making it the natural Valium in your healing crystal first aid kit. If chronic stress has you treading water, include Ocean Jasper in a healing layout to quiet down a ramped up nervous system. This highly polished sphere is 45mm in diameter and sits perfectly on our egg stands so it can be displayed to show off its colours, it would also make a lovely gift when given in one of our pouches. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description - Ocean Jasper Sphere 45mm<br />

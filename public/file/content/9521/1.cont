	This tantalisingly scented soap slice will leave you deeply moisturised with pure essential oils of ylang ylang and chamomile. This wonderful soap can be used like any normal bar of soap but is much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with or alternatively, rub the bar onto a sponge. This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being hand made the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Tickled Pink Soap Slice 100g.</p>

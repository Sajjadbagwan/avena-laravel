	This cheerful owl ornament is made out of solid resin so is water and frost resistant. The lovely owl looks like it is smiling at us as it is winking his big black eyes. The detailed design around its eyes, the cute round shapes, the beautiful still simple colouring and the cream finish makes this ornament would be a brilliant element of the garden, put somewhere high or just nestled between flowers or plant pots in the summer as well as sat anywhere inside the house, conservatory or office. This beautiful garden ornament is approx. 15cm wide and 20cm tall and is a great gift idea for someone whom is a lover of nature`s little creatures.</p>

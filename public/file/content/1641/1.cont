	Ammonite is named for Ammon, the Egyptian god of procreation and life. These ancient molluscs were similar to the modern squid or octopus, creatures of the open tropical seas. The characteristic spiral was formed by partitions or chambers of the coiled shell where they lived. Once the ammonite grew too large for its living chamber, it formed a new one and moved into it. The empty chambers filled with gas to assist different depths of the water. Ammonites became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period some 65 million years ago after a 330 million year survival on earth.</p>

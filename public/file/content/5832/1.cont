	This is a fantastic Witches&#39; Brew mug by Lisa Parker. Each mug is made from bone china and has been printed with a decorative transfer designed by Lisa Parker herself. On one side of the mug there is a green witch leaning on her arms and on the other there is a purple witch asleep on her arms, both against a black background. This item is dishwasher and microwave safe and comes packaged in a decorative cardboard gift box making it an ideal gift.</p>

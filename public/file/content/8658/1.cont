	The morning after feeling... when gravity seems stronger and problem after problem occurs such as you can&rsquo;t find your glasses, the kettle is broken, you forgot how much tequila you need to make scrambled eggs and you just tripped over the cat! Look no further because our concentrated hangover oil is here to rescue you!</p>
<p>
	Our Hangover Oil Concentrate is carefully blended with top quality, pure essential oils including cool peppermint, which is excellent for uplifting the mind and body; refreshing lemon to stimulate and clear the mind; sweet orange to help relaxation and last but not least herby fennel sweet oil to stimulate the appetite.</p>
<p>
	To use, put five drops in an oil burner and top up with water, then relax and let the soothing aroma do its job. Alternatively, put a few drops onto a damp cloth and place it on a radiator; the heat from the radiator acts as a candle would, vaporising the oil into the room without the worry of a burning candle or the water level in the burner just in case you fancy a nap!</p>
<p>
	Ingredients &ndash; peppermint essential oil (Mentha piperita), lemon essential oil (Citrus limon), orange essential oil (Citrus aurantium dulcis) and fennel sweet essential oil (Foeniculum vulgare). Please note that our Hangover Oil is a strong concentrate and is not to be used on the skin or taken internally! &copy; Please do not copy text - Avena product description - AVOIL33.</p>

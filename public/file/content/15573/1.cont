	This stunning Game of Thrones heat changing latte mug commemorates one of the most devastating battles so far, the Massacre at Hardhome, where the Night&#39;s Watch and the Free People battled against the White Walkers.</p>
<p>
	Cold, the mug shows the Stark house words &quot;Winter is Coming&quot; on the front, which is a warning not only against the cold season but against the White Walkers. The back shows The Night&#39;s Watch shield. When hot liquid is poured in, the mug transforms to reveal the Night King, leader of the White Walkers, watching as the remaining wildings and members of the Night&#39;s Watch evacuate by boat, surrounded by the thousands of wildlings that were killed. Once the drink is finished the mug returns to its original state as it cools. An essential for any Game of Thrones display!</p>

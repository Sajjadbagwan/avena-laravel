<p>A superb high quality Dark Angel figurine which is hauntingly gothic.&nbsp; The dark angel is thought provoking and has a serene aura.&nbsp; There are no facial features to the dark angel but her head is bowed with her hands in a prayer stance holding a red rose.&nbsp; More red roses are found entwined around the angels cloak.&nbsp; Her huge wings appear to offer her protection and comfort.&nbsp; The angel is also a candle holder, if so desired, as there is a discrete space for a candle to be held at the nape of the angels neck.&nbsp; Approx 26cm tall and wing diameter of 14cm.&nbsp; A beautiful piece which is perfect for display in any room and an ideal gift idea.</p>

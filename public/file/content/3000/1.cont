<p>This is a stunningly beautiful agate obelisk, each piece has been hand carved, polished and due to it being a natural product each piece is unique. The wonderful pink finish may be slightly lighter or darker than our picture and the beautiful swirling pattens you get within agate will alsodiffer, the average size is 13cm but again may be slightly smaller or larger. One thing for certain is your piece will have the wonderfull rich colour and agate patterns with the smooth polished finish but it will be 100% unique to you and no one else will have an exact one to match.</p>

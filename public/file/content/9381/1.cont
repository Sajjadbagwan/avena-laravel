	Wands have been used since ancient times to increase the power of spells. The pointed end of each wand directs the spell energy. Wands can be wrapped in silver or copper wire with other gemstones to personalise them for different uses. Wands are popular healing tools, used to channel energy in reflexology and massage. The stone should be chosen for its particular benefits and energies. Selenite or &lsquo;mineral gypsum&rsquo; is found on large salt plains and is created just beneath the surface. The word selenite comes from the Greek &lsquo;selenites&rsquo; meaning moon stone or moon rock. This wand is ideal to use during periods of meditation and for channelling energy. The average size for these wonderful selenite wands is approximately 15cm long and 2cm in dimeter but from wand to wand sizes may vary slightly. &copy; Please do not copy text.

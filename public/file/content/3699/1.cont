	A superior quality figurine by the fine art sculptor Anne Stokes. This &#39;Soul Mate&#39; figurine is a luxury piece and has deep rich colours and detail. It is hand painted and is made from cold cast porcelain resin. At first glance&nbsp;it appears that&nbsp;the dragon&#39;s wings belong to the girl, but at closer inspection we see that the dragon is actually embracing her. In the mystical world, once a dragon becomes your friend that friendship lasts forever. This fabulous figurine stands at approx 21cm tall and comes presented in a quality decorative box making this a perfect gift.</p>

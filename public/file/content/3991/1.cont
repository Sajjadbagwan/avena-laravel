The music has been specially crafted and precisely tuned to transmit each of the solfeggio frequencies. The compositions contain an array of sacred instruments and sounds such as crystal bowls and didgeridoo and sacred chants, which work to further enhance the effects of the solfeggio tones.These incredible tones each resonate to a specific frequency that our original blueprint is composed from. Exposing ourselves to these frequencies is said to help bring our bodies, cells and DNA back into balance. Different parts of our bodies and organs all have specific frequencies of optimum resonance (perfect state of health) and therefore listening to these tones allows the body to absorb and remember its original blueprint, moving it back towards its perfect state of alignment and resonance.</span></p>

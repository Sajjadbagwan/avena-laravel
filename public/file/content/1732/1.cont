	This delightful cute cherub is sleeping in a pair of feathered wings, making it look very fragile and delicate. The cherub is laying peacefully on its left side with its head resting on the back of its hand.&nbsp; In the traditional off white colour for cherubs, this is a beautiful single piece, but there is also a cherub laying on its right hand side available if a matching pair is more desirable to you! &nbsp;Cherubs are winged angelic beings and described in biblical tradition as attending on God. They represented in ancient Middle Eastern art as a loin or bull with eagles&rsquo; wings and a human face. Cherubs are regarded in traditional Christian angelology as an angel of the second highest order of the celestial hierarchy. Each of these gorgeous cherub figures measure approximately 14cm long and 8cm tall and come packed individually in a white box which makes it a lovely gift idea.</p>

	This relaxing soybean massage candle has been carefully blended using only the finest pure essential oils and natural plant waxes. The jojoba oil adds a tactile and luxury feel to this warm wax massage and the ingredients are extremely rich and moisturising so a little will go a long way. This super relaxing blend is made from sweet fennel and lavender with a fresh layer of peppermint. It is ideal for rubbing into those dry skin areas to replenish and nourish the skin. There is also no need to worry about the wax burning you as this special natural wax blend has a low melting point. It will melt at around 45c which is like warm bath water. How to use safely: light the candle and allow it&nbsp;to burn until a pool of wax has formed, then blow out the flame. You&nbsp;can now&nbsp;directly pour the wax from the jar onto the skin. As with all massage preparation we recommend that a small skin test is done first to ensure that the person being massaged does not have an allergic reaction to the oil. This massage candle is not recommended to use on the face and please take special care to avoid contact with eyes. Why&nbsp;not turn down the lights and set the mood with some relaxing music? The candle in the jar measures 7cm tall and 6.5cm in diameter.&nbsp;</p>

	<span style="font-size:14px;">Music for Healing is the perfect toolkit to pursue and assist a chosen therapy, energy or pastime. The music has been crafted to produce an ambience that allows the mind freedom for healing, visualisation and relaxation with consistent mood and texture. Allow this tranquil music to heal the body and the soul by letting go of the worries and issues that distract the mind. A gently plucked acoustic guitar intimately and softly plays whilst you relax. Special musical layers of ambient synthesised textures suggest light and energy that surge and swell around the soft tones of the guitar. This album has been compiled by Medwin Goodall in close collaboration with various alternative therapists; an essential tool for both the professional therapist and the absolute beginner.&nbsp;</span></p>

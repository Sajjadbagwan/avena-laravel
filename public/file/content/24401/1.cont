	Jet, sometimes known a Lignite, is a very strong stone used for protection and grounding. Its origin is organic, having been created through decaying wood under extreme pressure.<br />
	Thumb stones are also known as worry stones and are made of smooth, polished gemstones in the shape of an oval with a thumb-sized indentation. They are used by holding the stone between the index finger and thumb, gently moving one&#39;s thumb back and forth across the stone. These worry stones are ideal to use for crystal healing and are useful tools in meditation. This wonderful thumb stone measures 4cm x 3cm wide.</p>

	This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust, but we can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as it comes in and change the photo as each one sells, so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we will be happy to help.&nbsp;</p>

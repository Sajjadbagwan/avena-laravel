	Spodge the gargoyle has been designed in a comical style, finished with dark black and grey colours and in a brilliant pose. This fantastic gargoyle is lying on his side with his legs crossed and looking up in the sky with his bright yellow eyes. By the smile on his face and with his finger lying on his leg we can tell that Spodge is waiting for something, probably for a brilliant picture to be taken of him? This gargoyle is not shy; all he is wearing are his brown shoes and his long black hair covering his back. This ornament is made of resin and&nbsp;makes a fantastic element of a garden just put next to a flowering plant or put on top of other ornaments, but as brilliant as&nbsp;it is to be put outside he is just as&nbsp;at home indoors by the fireplace or with part of a collection. This gargoyle is approx. 14cm long, 9cm wide and 8cm tall and is packed in a block of polystyrene for safe transit and then in a plain white box. He would make a wonderful gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures.</p>

	This spooky green witch is wearing a black dress with a spider crawling up it and a black hat, all made of plastic. On the front of the base there is a solar panel which powers the rocking motion. The witch&rsquo;s hips are swaying from side to side and her arms are moving up and down in the same rhythm. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light make the rocking movement, but to really get her going she likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not toys, and are not suitable for children under three years old due to small parts. Each witch comes in a clear plastic box and is 10cm tall. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	On the front of&nbsp;this dancing queen flip flap there is a solar panel which powers the dancing motion. Her hand moves up and down as her hips sway from side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get her dancing, but to really get her going she likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not made as toys and are not suitable for children under 36 months&nbsp;of age&nbsp;due to small parts. Each&nbsp;flip flap&nbsp;comes in a clear cellophane bubble display. She is 11cm tall x 5.5cm wide.</p>

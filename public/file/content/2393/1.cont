	This item has been made by welding everyday metal objects together such as nails, screws, chain, washers, bolts, lengths of metal, small pieces of sheet metal and more. The whole thing has then been electroplated which is an electrochemical process that deposits a thin layer of metal onto a metal base to create a glossy metallic finish and fantastic looking Chinese dragon. This item is not recommended for young children due to small parts and some sharp edges. Each item comes packaged in its own plain box. Dimensions: Length 46cm, height 17cm.

	Handmade in Bali, this stunning long dream catcher has 7 coloured hoops, each which represents one of the 7 chakras. They are aligned just as the seven chakras are aligned along the spine in the human body. Each chakra location has a unique meaning, orientation and healing potential. The Sahasrara is the Crown Chakra, represented by&nbsp;the purple hoop, and is related to thought and self-knowledge. Ajna is the Brow Chakra, represented by the dark blue hoop, and is related to intuition and clarity. Vushuddha is the Throat Chakra represented by the turquoise hoop, and is related to sound and self-expression. Anahata is the Heart Chakra represented by the green hoop, and is related to love and compassion. Manipura is the Solar Plexus Chakra represented by the yellow hoop, and is related to growth and personal power. Svadhisthana is the Sacral Chakra represented by the orange hoop, and is related to creativity and enthusiasm. Muladhara is the Base Chakra represented by the red hoop, and is related to physical identity and self-preservation.</p>

A wooden incense smoke box with an intricate fretwork design for incense stick and cone burning and storage, beautifully finished with a two tone lid (light wood & dark wood) and three gold elephants across the front. It has been cut with the fretwork pattern along the lid. Each end of the box has small drilled holes inside in which incense sticks can be placed for burning and on the base there is two brass wells for burning incense cones. The lid can then be closed as the incense is burning allowing the smoke and aroma escapes through the fretwork. There is also a hidden compartment under the box in which incense sticks can be stored with a secret door on the end. Dimensions: Length 25cms.

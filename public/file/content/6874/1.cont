	These lovely small and round one-hoop traditional dream catchers are decorated with a brown bead and brown/white feathers, making the dream catchers very pleasing to the eye. Smaller dream catchers such as this are ideal for travel or taking on holiday and are often hung in cars, trucks and caravans etc. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Dream catchers are very popular with children suffering bad dreams.</p>

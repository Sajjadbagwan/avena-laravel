	This fairy is a beautiful looking piece (in our view) and ideal for any time of year. The piece itself is called &lsquo;Wistful Moments&rsquo;.&nbsp; She is kneeling on a large mushroom, with rocks around the bottom and there&#39;s also a smaller mushroom and a butterfly that has landed on a leaf. The wonderful colours that have been used on this fairy and her surroundings are great and the detail is perfect from the delicate facial features to&nbsp;her hair in the breeze, her patterned tights to the small leaves on the ground and the butterfly. She is approx. 15cm tall and comes packaged in a nice &lsquo;Mushroom Fairy&rsquo; box making an ideal gift idea.</p>

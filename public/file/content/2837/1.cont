	Sly the gargoyle has been formed in a detailed grotesque design and finished with black and grey colours. This gargoyle is sitting down with his toes placed on each other and with one arm on his leg and another at his chin. He puts one finger near his mouth which makes him look like he is deep in thought&nbsp;and is planning his next twisted move. He has two little horns and two wings with light coloured spikes running between them. He has bright yellow eyes with red effect. He also has long grey nails and a tail that is curled up behind him. Sly makes a fantastic ornament in a garden next to a plant pot as well as put in the house or conservatory, by the fireplace or towards a collection. He is made of solid resin and is packed in a polystyrene tube for safe transit, then put in a brown box. This ornament is heavier than it looks and is approx. 18x20cm wide and 21cm tall. Sly would make the perfect gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures.</p>

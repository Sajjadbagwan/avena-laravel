	Each of these charming Flip Flaps are made from bright colourful plastic. On the back of the elephant there is a solar panel which powers the flip flap motion. The elephant&rsquo;s trunk moves up and down making the ears flap. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light make the Flip Flaps move, but to really get them flapping they like strong direct sunlight. These items are not toys and are not suitable for children under 36 months old due to small parts. Each Flip Flap comes in a clear cellophane bubble display.&nbsp;</p>

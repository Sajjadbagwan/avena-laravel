	This lovely, laughing sitting Buddha is very attractive to the eye with the gold colour of&nbsp;his skin and the cream colour of the robe. This Buddha is sitting down with his bare chest showing and is&nbsp;holding a bowl in his&nbsp;right hand. The Buddha is the ultimate symbol of happiness, wealth and good fortune. Buddha&#39;s belly is said to signify bountiful wealth and prosperity and by stroking it, it is believed to bring much good luck. The laughing Buddha must always be invited into his new home, resulting in positive Chi and bringing great happiness. Always place your Buddha in a position of honour and never on the floor. He can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or office but avoid bathrooms and toilets. This laughing Buddha measures approx. 13.5cm tall and is 24cm x 13cm wide.</p>

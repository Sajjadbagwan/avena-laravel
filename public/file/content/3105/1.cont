	Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dreamcatcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams or important messages through into the feathers and then down onto the person sleeping and catching all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams these wolf designs are now our best sellers. This dreamcatcher is approx 48cm long from the hook to the bottom feather.

It is a lovely piece to decorate any home with whilst it sends off delicious aromas within the room. The mushroom is a dark shade of brown with a few small blotches of light brown around the base. The mushroom oil burner itself stands at approx. 10cm tall. To use simply add a few drops of the fragrance oil of your personal choice to a small amount of water in the top part of the mushroom (through the holes); then place a candle underneath and let the oil burner do its magic.</span></p>

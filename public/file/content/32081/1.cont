	This highly polished angel ornament is handcrafted from natural Sodalite stone and stands on its own<br />
	This fantastic angel would make the perfect addition to any room of the home or would make the perfect gift idea for someone special as a small gesture to lift faith or for protection etc.<br />
	Sodalite is a rich blue to purple colour with a wonderful stone pattern throughout. It helps balance intellect and intuition; helps clear the mind, bring joy and relieve a heavy heart.&nbsp;<br />
	This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.<br />
	This wonderful carved angel measures H3cm x W1cm x L2cm, a handy pocket size so you can carry it with you anywhere you go.</p>

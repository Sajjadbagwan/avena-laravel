	This spectacular deck captures the perceptive powers of the legendary dragon. Dragon tarot represents the fulfilment of centuries of research into symbolism by mystics from the world over. Dragons are a legend in many cultures, and they appear in quite a few different colours and poses in this highly popular 78 card Dragon Tarot deck from fantasy artist Peter Pracownik. The artwork and symbolism, combined with the rich history, myth, and mystique that surrounds dragons in general is truly brought to life in this deck. The use of many rich colours is fantastic throughout and one of the best parts about this deck are the Major Arcana. They capture all the symbolism of traditional tarot decks, but they also contain a draconic twist that is sometimes a bit funny (in particular, the Hanging Dragon card!). Each tarot deck is supplied sealed, shrunk wrapped and have never been opened for display or photos.&nbsp;</p>

	Angelite is a fascinating blue stone with a peaceful, calming and soothing energy. It is believed that the angelite stone helps you to connect with angels and is the perfect tool to use to assist you to make contact with your spirit guide. Angelite is also an extremely powerful healing crystal. Palmstones are the perfect way to ease stress and aid relaxation. Made from a wide range of natural semi-precious stones they are cut into an oval shape approximately 70mm long x 50mm wide. They are then highly polished making them a pleasurable shape and texture to hold. Each with their unique properties, they are also ideal to place under your pillow at night, use for meditation or chakra healing; simply as a way to collect some wonderful semi-precious stones or as an ideal gift idea as they are perfect for slipping inside a greetings card or one of our drawstring pouches. All our palmstones are solid natural stones meaning that the colour, pattern or shade may vary from stone to stone and differ from the images shown giving you your own unique piece. Unfortunately we can&#39;t photograph every stone we send out as this would not be cost effective.</p>

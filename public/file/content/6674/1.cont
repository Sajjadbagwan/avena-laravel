	Obsidian is a lovely black stone with a beautiful pattern throughout. Known as the stone of purity bringing balance, protection and security to the body, mind and spirit, it is also said to be beneficial for the skin and veins. Black obsidian is the birthstone for Capricorn (21st Dec - 10th Jan) and the symbol of safety. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our bracelets are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary from stone to stone and differ slightly from the image shown giving you your own unique piece. Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

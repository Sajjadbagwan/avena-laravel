	Autumn fairy is a wonderful looking piece ideal (in our view) for any time of year. She is kneeling in grass and leaves while resting herself on a large toadstool. The autumnal colours are great and the detail is perfect from the intricate ivy tattoos on the fairy to the tiny leaves and smaller toadstools on the forest floor. She is 110mm tall and comes packaged in a nice &lsquo;fairy collection&rsquo; box making an ideal gift idea.</p>

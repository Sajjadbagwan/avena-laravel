	<span style="font-size: 12px">This fantastic mini swan is carved from onyx with a polished finish and is smooth to the touch. The swan stands 3cm tall and 4cm long. Onyx is formed over thousands of years, mostly in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains. An onyx forms in parallel bands with a variety of colours mainly greens and browns, and it is often used for carving.&nbsp;Please note that as onyx is a naturally formed product each piece may vary slightly in colour and pattern from the picture shown.</span></p>

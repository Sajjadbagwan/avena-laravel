	Fill your home with this gorgeous candle blended together with plump and ripened fruits rich with spices on base notes of crunchy praline. This fantastic candle in a jar would make the perfect gift idea for any occasion especially for Christmas and it measures 12cm tall and 8.5cm in diameter. Fragrance has the power to stir emotions, stimulate the senses and evoke memories. This wonderful range of jarred candles contains only the finest fragrances to capture each moment in an aroma. The ingredients for this luxurious range were sourced from well-known European fragrance houses with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity of fragrance. German-sourced cotton wicks are used and American soy wax that burns clearer, is renewable, sustainable and kinder to the environment. All this means that you can enjoy these beautiful aromas in the knowledge that the whole manufacturing process has its heart in nature. This fantastic range of candles was designed with you (the end user) in mind and is the art of home fragrances so why not have your own little piece of luxury that doesn&rsquo;t cost the earth?</p>

	This solid resin gargoyle has been designed in a Gothic style and finished in a weathered green effect with great detail and a brilliant pose. This gargoyle is sitting on a stone throne with his chin resting on his fist in a thinking posture. He is ideal for outdoor use as a unique garden ornament and would look great in the garden or lodged into a garden wall. He is packed in his own box making an ideal gift and is 15cm tall.</p>

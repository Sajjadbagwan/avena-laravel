Slip grumpy stones into pockets, onto desks, into work areas, or place directly into hands. Simple, effective, and inexpensive, give one today! Grumpies are adult medication.</span><span style="font-size: 12px">These wonderful stones each come with an information card containing all the above text for you to give with your grumpy if you wish (for people who are grumpy but don&rsquo;t know it yet). These are hand made so every grumpy is wonderfully unique. If you order just one we will hand pick it for you, they are all wonderful so you are guaranteed a good one. If you order our set of four we will send a selection of light and dark ones while also choosing different expressions for you. They are ideal for outdoor use if required, as they look great in the garden too. Each grumpy is approximately 4cm across. We can also supply these in bulk and they make ideal gifts for large companies especially if you modify the information cards making them relevant to you or your company.&nbsp;</span></p>

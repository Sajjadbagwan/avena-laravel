This finds its practical application in their dealings with their suppliers, customers and the environment. They give all their overseas suppliers a fair price, build real and lasting connections with them, monitor fair wages and good working conditions, minimise any environmental impact and use some of their profits to benefit the communities in which these products are made. One example is that since 2005, in an on-going programme, they have donated funds to help schools and orphanages in Bali that are in need of equipment and repairs. Help is also provided to pay school fees for children whose parents are unable to pay. Staff of our supplier volunteer to visit schools, orphanages and students&#39; homes to ensure funds are given where most needed and used as intended. In the last three years funds have been used to pay for school fees and books, to purchase sports equipment such as footballs and badminton equipment, to fix a leaking roof and to donate a much needed computer and printer to a school. &copy; Please do not copy text.

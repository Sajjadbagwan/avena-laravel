	This &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo; looking character is a unique door knocker or novelty wall plaque named &#39;Boldly&#39; and is from the Dryads collection. He&#39;s made from solid resin and finished in a weathered green effect with fantastic detail throughout from the cheeky grin to the fine detail on the leaves surrounding the face. There is a metal keyhole type slot to the rear for fastening him to a door or wall. Measuring approx 17cm tall he is packed in a polystyrene block and in his own box for safe delivery and would make a quirky gift.</p>

	James Stone Shield Knight is full of character. He would make a great gift to add to any fantasy collection or can even be the start of a collection himself. James stands proud and fearless at 8cm tall and 4cm wide. He is wearing his full suit of metal armour and helmet. He has an angry expression on his face showing he is ready for battle. He has his grey shield held tightly with his left hand ready to defend himself whilst in his right hand he proudly holds his flag.</p>

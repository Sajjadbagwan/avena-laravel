	This Santa &lsquo;Ho Ho Ho&rsquo; sign is full of character and would make a great Christmas accessory in any home. The Santas are on a solid base and so they stand very sturdily on a surface. Each Santa is holding up a &lsquo;Ho&rsquo; sign in the air to create the full saying. The Santas are each dressed in different coloured clothes and stand in different poses. There&#39;s also a snow effect on top of the letters and on the ground like it has all settled ready for a white Christmas. The sign is 15cm long, 9.5cm tall and 2.5cm wide.</p>

	Rocks and minerals have been treasured and collected for centuries so here you can find some information on some of the types you can buy. This very useful information and reference card is produced and printed by one of our natural stone suppliers. This plastic card is of great quality and colour, it is double-sided and contains pictures of rocks and minerals including brief descriptions of how old they are and where they originate from. This fantastic A5 information card is ideal as a reference if you are a collector of rocks and minerals and it would make the perfect gift paired up with one of our lovely stones.</p>

<p>Grains of time is a wonderful gothic sand timer made from quality resin and finished in a brushed grey effect. The top and base are both heart shaped and decorated with small red roses that then trail down each of the three pillars. The glass timer is then set inside the piece and contains black sand. Excellent quality and detail throughout this really is a fantastic piece, measuring 15cm tall and carefully packed in its own box it would also make an ideal gift.</p>

	As one of life&#39;s daily necessities, it&#39;s easy to take soap for granted. At it&#39;s most basic, soap is a mix of lye and oil that serves the simple purpose of keeping us clean. Yet it can be so much more, as demonstrated by the Avena range of <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/soaps/">natural soaps</a>.</p>

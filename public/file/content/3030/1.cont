	This is a four hoop stunning black dream catcher. The web within each hoop is almost a rainbow of colours and is decorated with black feathers, making the dream catcher very pleasing to the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams.</p>

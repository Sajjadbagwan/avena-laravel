	This charming and very festive teddy bear is wearing a red scarf and a Santa hat, all made of plastic. On the front of the base there is a solar panel which powers the rocking motion. The teddy&rsquo;s head is nodding from side to side and his little feet are moving up and down in the same rhythm. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light make the rocking move, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not toys, and are not suitable for children under three years old due to small parts. Each teddy comes in a clear cellophane bubble display and he is 10cm tall.</p>

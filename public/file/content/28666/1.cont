	Himalayan crystal salt stones contain minerals that naturally kill bacteria and therefore odour. They can be used to wash hands, used as an underarm deodorant, or to apply to certain skin conditions. They are especially popular with people who are sensitive or allergic to chemicals found in soaps and who want to wash their hands safely and naturally making these heart soap stones or deodorants a great natural antibacterial alternative.</p>
<p>
	The salt stones originate from the Himalayan Mountains and are hand-carved into various shapes and sizes. This heart shape is one of the most popular and as well as a functional product it also makes a lovely decorative piece but please note as a natural product they can vary slightly in colour from dark orange to near white. The hearts measure approximately 8cm x 6cm.</p>

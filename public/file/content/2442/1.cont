	Specially developed for animals&#39; udders and teats with a blend of natural ingredients including tea tree along with lavender, eucalyptus, geranium and rose essential oils. The tea tree plant has been used by Aborigines for thousands of years and much has been written about its wonderful soothing and disinfecting properties. It is a natural insect repellent, has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties making this product well worth trying out on your herd. Due to legislation stating that natural products such as this cannot be advertised for mastitis we can&rsquo;t put this anywhere on our labels, packing or literature but the feedback we get about how well this product works is remarkable. Avena started to supply this product to farmers and auction marts around The Yorkshire Dales many years ago and it is now used by many more farmers across the UK and even in Europe just by word of mouth. This is a 100% natural remedy with no chemical additives.</p>

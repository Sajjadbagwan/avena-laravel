	<span>Empty plastic bottles in blue with a black atomiser or mist spray screw on cap which is ideal for facial and body sprays, room fresheners, spray on massage oils or any product that needs to be sprayed plus bathroom products as they are less likely to break than glass. Made from quality plastic they are also a lot lighter than glass making them ideal to transport, ship or mail out liquids. The colour of the plastic bottle protects the contents from light damage, keeps them fresh and prolongs the shelf life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

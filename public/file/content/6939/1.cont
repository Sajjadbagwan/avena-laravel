	This lovely deck of tarot cards was created by the artists Antonio Lupatelli and Peter Doyle who interpret signs through enchanted dreams and the magic of the Ageless People. Distant relatives of the gnomes, the fairies are very joyful beings who play naughty jokes at times. The fairies, however, also like to help humans in very practical ways like through these cards. The Fairy Tarot is actually enchanted: it allows reality to be confronted using a positive attitude, easily playing down all kinds of trouble and overcoming problems objectively. This fantastic deck of tarot cards features 78 divining tarot cards&nbsp;in the size of 44mm x 80mm making it the perfect tool to carry in your pocket and use whenever, wherever.</p>

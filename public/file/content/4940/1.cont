	These novel soap sponges are a new and fantastic way to lather up in the shower or bath. Each massage soap sponge starts life as a round massaging sponge, soft on one side and exfoliating on the other (click title to see more images). The sponges are then individually filled with a quality soap base and compressed. When set this creates these wonderfully fragranced massaging soap sponges. They can be used in the shower, hand basin and even float in the bath making them ideal for kids as well as adults. They are a good hand size when new and weigh 240g. Use either the base of the soap sponge for a luxurious lather, or the top for an intense&nbsp;skin exfoliation and feel good massage. Each soap sponge is expected to last up to eight weeks and smells divine, made with quality oils the aroma lasts as long as the sponges and one alone can fill a bathroom with its luxury scent. With plenty of fragrances and colours to choose from these make a fantastic addition to any bathroom and a fabulous gift idea.&nbsp;</p>

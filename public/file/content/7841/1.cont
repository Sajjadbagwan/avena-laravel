	This fantastic Feng Shui chime from Woodstock is named after Wood, one of the five elements within Feng Shui. It has five quality silver aluminium tubes and a black ash wood finish with a silk-screened wind catcher and genuine aventurine stone accent. The chime hangs at 42cm long, so would be suitable for both inside and outside use. The original musical scale for this chime was developed through chance by casting coins and referencing the I Ching. This chime is believed to bring the energy of balance and nourishment into your life. So why not treat yourself with the healing Feng Shui powers of the colour green and Wood element?</p>

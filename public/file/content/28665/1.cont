	Himalayan Salt Stone Massage is an innovative healing technique and either hot or cold stones can be used. They are said to ground and balance the body&rsquo;s electromagnetic field, central nervous system and meridians. They can gently soothe away an accumulation of stress, tension and pollutants, while bringing the mind, body and spirit, into balance. When the stones are heated negative ions are produced which aid a sense of inner peace and deep relaxation. The massage heat can then go deeper into the muscles and loosen stiff joints.</p>

	The salt stones originate from the Himalayan Mountains and are hand-carved into various shapes and sizes. This heart shape is one of the most popular and as well as a functional product it also makes a lovely decorative piece but please note as a natural product they can vary slightly in colour from dark orange to near white. The hearts measure approximately 8cm x 6cm.</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This charming owl slate hanger is cut from sturdy natural slate and finished with a rustic looking rope hanger. Adding to the charm the edges of the slate are rough cut which makes each slate slice slightly unique. Printed on the slate are the closed eyes and triangular nose of the owl as well as &lsquo;With Much Love&rsquo; making this the perfect idea for someone special or a family member. The slate is ideal to hang on a wall, door, garden gate, in a shed or even attached to or included in a present as a gift tag for that special extra touch. The reverse of the slate is blank and a great idea is to also add your own unique message here using chalk or a marker. They can also be inserted into gift cards and are great additions when sent through the post this way. The slate is a fine-grained rock derived from an original shale-type rock composed of clay or volcanic ash. This cute owl slate gift measures 7cm long and 6.5cm wide excluding the rope and fits ideally into our handy black drawstring pouch as a great addition.</span></p>

	This hanging dotty butterfly is made from felt using a mixture of lovely bright colours. It&nbsp;is attached to a red silk loop hanger so can be hung easily on walls, windows, doors or wherever takes your fancy. It would look beautiful and be a great accessory in a child&#39;s bedroom. The butterfly measures 11cm wide and 13cm long. Windhors<strong>e</strong>&nbsp;is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. They build real&nbsp;and lasting connections with their suppliers and give all suppliers a fair price, whilst also monitoring fair wages&nbsp;and good working conditions.&nbsp;The business is owned by a charity, which donates money to social projects in the communities of our suppliers, and also to Buddhist projects around the world. An example of one of these projects is the support of an orphanage. &ldquo;We support the Ban Rom Sai Orphanage in northern Thailand, which provides a home to 30 children, including some who contracted HIV at birth. The home aims to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the children, and help them find a skill they are good at and enjoy.&rdquo; The orphanage was established in 1999 and is dedicated to providing a safe home for children aged 2-17 years old. From the get-go the aim was not to just be an orphanage but more of a &lsquo;big family&rsquo; for the children. Through the commitment of staff and volunteers they achieved that. They work on a trial and error basis, working closely with the children and let them be actively involved in discussions and decisions about their lives.</p>

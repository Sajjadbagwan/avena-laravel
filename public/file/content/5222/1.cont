	&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px;">This round duckling is extremely cute, with its tuft of feathers on its head, its baby wings tucked by its sides, adorable big brown eyes and its cartoon orange beak wide open showing off a little pink tongue. How could you not fall in love with him? He oozes cheeky character, looking like he just want to play but at the same time be so loveable yet mischievous. Made from quality resin he is suitable for outdoor use as part of our garden range (although we recommend that he is not left out during harsh, frosty weather and very bad winters) but he also makes a lovely indoors ornament and great gift idea. He measures 13cm wide and 13cm tall.</span></p>

	This bundle of 10 cinnamon scented pine cones are great for the Christmas season. There are so many different things they can be used for to the best of their potential, such as extra Christmas decorations around your house sending off lovely warm aromas, putting that final touch to decorated wreaths or simply just in a bowl to admire the smell and the natural look of the pine cones. If feeling experimental, why not spray your pine cones a festive colour, i.e. gold /silver or even with some fake snow. The pine cones are different sizes but on average are approx.8cm long.</p>

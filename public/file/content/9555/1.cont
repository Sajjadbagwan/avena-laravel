	A set of TWELVE beautiful bath treats. Our beautiful hand-made bath mallows contain just enough cocoa and shea butter to fill a bath with rich, nourishing, creamy and moisturising luxurious goodness. They are one of the easiest, most convenient and fun way to enjoy natural essential oils and aromatherapy in everyday life. Simply drop one into the bath and relax as it gently fizzes and melts, each creating a luxurious but different aroma. This set will always contain twelve different and lovely bath mallows from our &pound;2.99 range, we can&rsquo;t always guarantee an exact duplicate of the image as some go out of stock but we can guarantee all will be unique and all from the best sellers with a mix of wonderful colors and aromas. The whole pack can be given as a luxury gift set or as they are wrapped individually it can be split up and they can be given out as individual gifts while keeping some for yourself. Alternatively they can all be kept for your own indulgence and we won&rsquo;t tell anyone. We will also include a special 25% off voucher which you can use on your next order or pass on if they are a gift. To use, simply drop your bath mallow into a bath of warm water and watch as it fizzes, releasing its perfume and essential oils. Rinse bath well after use.

	This charming set of four toadstools makes an ideal addition for any garden, patio, conservatory or plant pot and would also make a cracking decoration indoors placed on the windowsill, mantelpiece, and shelf or even in an indoor plant pot. Each toadstool is approximately 6cm tall and has a matt finish on the stem with a glossed finish on the top. This fantastic set of toadstools would make the perfect gift idea for someone who is a lover of garden ornament and would make a wonderful addition to an existing fairy garden. Each set is as pictured with one green top and the others more rustic but as these are hand finished the finish may vary slightly from the image. They are wonderful quality and come packed as a set of four. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Set Of Four Mini Toadstools.</p>

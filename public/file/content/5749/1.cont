	These hand painted strawberry shaped soaps look amazing and smell divine. Cute, sweet, adorable, tempting are just some of the words we would use to describe these soaps but we could go on and on complimenting the little strawberries. Their colour and scent will make you feel like summer has come to stay all year round, and we all love that feeling!&nbsp;These soaps are often used purely for decoration as they look so fabulous and can simply be placed in rooms to release their fragrance and look pretty. As these soaps come presented in a lovely box they would also be great to give as a gift. As the soap is hand painted with harmless food colouring, before the first use of the soap rinse it under warm water for 2-3 minutes, gently rubbing off the colouring. Then your pure natural soap is ready to use. If they are just being used purely for their decorative effect, if kept away from humidity your soaps will continue to look beautiful for many years.</p>

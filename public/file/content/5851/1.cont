	This absolutely amazing looking clock&nbsp;shows the clock face at the top of a tower which is made from resin. Beneath the clock face there are three reapers in the wall of the tower, where there are also two dragons one underneath the clock and the other protectively over the top, looking fierce and there to warn anyone off. There is a scroll sign written across the bottom of the clock/ornament saying &lsquo;Time waits for no one.&rsquo; The ornament surrounding the clock is finished in a deep grey colour with deep purple roses and green stems twisted around the wall of the tower. It measures 25cm tall and 13cm wide. This fantastic piece would make a great gift for someone who collects or likes Nemesis Now figurines and especially if they are into fantasy gifts.</p>

	These wonderful organza bags filled with delicious dried oranges, limes, chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks and other wonderful pieces of heaven are a very decorative way to fragrance your home during the festive season. They were originally made to be hung by the radiator so the warmth coming off it can help give the dried fruits a boost to push the fantastic aromas around the home. The organza bags themselves are decorative pieces making them perfect to also be hung around the home to welcome guests with these gorgeous scents which can be refilled with our fanatstic Christmas Mix fragrance oil. These organza bags of citrus would also make a charming gift idea at Christmas and would make a nice gesture attached to larger presents for that special extra touch. Each bag measures approximately 13cm tall and 10cm wide.</p>

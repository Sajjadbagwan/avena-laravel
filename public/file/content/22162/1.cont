	This original set of coasters is official &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; merchandise, and all four are different: one is colored white and decorated with images of hot cups of coffee and the logo of the popular and well-loved New York caf&eacute; of &lsquo;Central Perk&rsquo;, is colored blue with a yellow picture frame and writing that reads &lsquo;Welcome to the real world... it sucks.&rsquo;, one is coloured red and white with the writing that reads &lsquo;Hello my name is Regina Phalange&rsquo; and last but not least the fourth one is coloured yellow with black writing &lsquo;We were on a break!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>
	This fantastic set of 4 coasters would make the perfect gift idea for all those &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; lovers. It would also make a cracking addition to an existing &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; collection.</p>

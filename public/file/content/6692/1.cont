	This is a stunning bath blaster with a musky, sexy scent and a rich, deep purple colour. It has a pretty, fresh white sugar flower embedded deep into the top of it. Its beautiful aroma is created with pure and high quality lavender and ylang ylang essential oils.&nbsp;Relaxing notes of soothing chamomile and warming ginger lead through to a heart of fresh eucalyptus and classic lavender, highlighted by thyme, spicy black pepper and cedarwood essential oils.&nbsp;This lovely bath blaster is perfect for a gift or to treat yourself. Directions for use: drop your bath blaster into a bath of warm water and watch as it fizzes, releasing its perfume and essential oils. Your bath blaster can be used up to four times so remember to take it out and pop it on the side for the next time you want to emerge yourself in these fantastic aromas.</p>

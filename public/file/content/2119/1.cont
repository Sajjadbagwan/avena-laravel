	This lovely little frog is sitting on a lily pad, holding onto the edge as it was ready to jump in the water or after a pray. Its beautiful bright colours and the detailed design makes it the perfect element of the garden next to a pond or just nestled between the flowers, but would fit nicely inside the house towards a collection or just sitting nicely in the kitchen or bathroom as well. This charming frog is made out of resin and is water and frost resistant. It would make a perfect gift to someone who loves the art of these fantastic ornaments. This frog is approx. 13cm long and 10ml tall.</p>

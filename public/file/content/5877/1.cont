	Thought to originate in China over 2000 years ago, the candle has been bringing light and comforting ambience to the world for many generations. These days, there is a wide range of candles in a multitude of shapes, sizes, and even fragrances.</p>

	Being a relatively inexpensive luxury, candles are a popular gift. From the decadent sweet aroma of a &quot;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/black-moonlight-candle-35-hour/">Black Moonlight Candle</a>&quot;, which has a burn time of up to 35 hours, to a delicate, freshly-scented &quot;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/classic-linen-votive-candle/">Classic Linen Votive Candle</a>&quot; providing sweet springtime notes, there is a candle that suits anyone and any environment. For any occasion!</p>

	For many years, candles have been synonymous with the Christmas season. Traditionally, candles were burned on the branches of a Christmas tree before the introduction of electricity. The Advent candle, too, is a timeless tradition of counting down the days to December 25th. No Christmas Eve is complete without the serene magic and atmosphere provided by candles such as the beautiful &quot;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Church-Candle-30-Hour/">Church Candle</a>&quot;, especially when bunched together to deliver that flickering light show that is so completely Christmas.</p>

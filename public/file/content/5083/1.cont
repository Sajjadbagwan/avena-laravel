	<span style="font-size: 12px">Red striped agate is as treasured as ordinary agate for being a good overall healing stone that can also assist in discovering the truth. It is said to ease painful conditions such as bruises, strains and sprains. Crystals or healing gemstones have been used throughout history for their healing qualities and beauty. Many people believe that each stone emits a certain energy which can have a beneficial effect on your&nbsp;well being. Does it work? Wear one, carry one with you, have them in your house or take one to bed to find out. All our stones are of a&nbsp;fantastic quality, rich in colour, smooth and polished. The average stone is 20-30mm but this does vary slightly as each is a unique natural shape and they make a fantastic gift idea in our mini drawstring pouches.</span></p>

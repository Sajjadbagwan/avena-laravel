Runes are thought by some to be a way of interacting with both the spirit and the living world. The system of premonition by runes can be credited to two tribes who came together and produced a combination of symbols and old signs which were found on a variety of paintings, ritual and domestic items in the North from as early as Paleolithic times. There are, however, other myths surrounding the origins of the runes including the Volsungr, a Northern ancestral tribe who crossed into Europe before the Ice Age. Today the use of the runes seems to be enjoying a modern day revival with collections becoming widely available. They are great to collect or to give as a gift. &copy; Please do not copy text.

The hearty fragrance awakens the senses whilst also easing the body and mind into a relaxed state. Whilst the mix of sandalwood, amber and sweet almond create a powerful woody scent, the mix of vanilla and fig gently soften this fragrance to create the perfect aroma for a cosy night in. This bottle contains 200ml and can last up to 4 months.</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222; font-size: 9pt"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

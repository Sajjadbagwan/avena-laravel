	This beautiful hematite bracelet is made of solid cut and polished hematite stones, carefully drilled and fitted on strong elastic so one size fits all. Hematite is a wonderful gunmetal grey/black colour and often looks more like a metal than a mineral. It is said to protect and strengthen determination and self-awareness whilst also enhancing personal magnetism, will and courage. Hematite is also believed to be beneficial for blood flow, stress and the nerves.&nbsp;Often bought simply as stylish jewellery, it would make a stunning gift.</p>

	This pack contains three 100% natural white sage sticks which are known for their rich scents and natural qualities that are suitable for the purification of your home, meditation room and other surroundings. Each bundle is harvested by hand and dried under the sun in accordance with Native American tradition. Smudge sticks have been used for centuries by Native Americans and are known for their protecting, cleansing and healing properties. Smudge sticks are known for their use in rituals or ceremonies to cleanse people, objects and places of negative energy. It is said that cleansing your house should be undertaken a couple of times a year, to clear negative energy that may have arrived. To use your smudge stick: light the tip and then blow it out (like you would an incense stick). Surround your body, the objects or a certain place you would like to cleanse with the smoke. Traditionally the ash is caught in a shell as this is also an ideal place to place an extinguished smudge stick. If you do not have a shell, a bowl would be fine to hold underneath instead. To extinguish the stick smother the end (like you would a cigarette) but please be aware that the stick may continue to burn, so double check once smothered. &copy; Please do not copy text.

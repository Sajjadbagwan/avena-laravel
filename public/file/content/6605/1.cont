	This black Earth chime is made from genuine hardwood with a cherry wood and weather resistant finish. It has heavy duty nylon strings, whilst the tubes are a special powder coated aluminium alloy that will not rust and come with a one-year warranty. The black Earth chime comes carefully packed in a lovely box making it an ideal gift. This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance. It is hand-tuned to a universal, pentatonic (five-note) scale and acts in concert with the wind to create random patterns of wonderful sound. Named for the &#39;blue planet&#39;, the planet we call home and also the third planet from the sun. Earth is the only planet whose name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology.&nbsp;This wonderful chime hangs at approximately 80cm long.</p>

	Woodstock&rsquo;s Chimes for Autism is a charitable chime, 100% of the wholesale after-tax profits from this chime are donated to research and educational organisations focused on autism. Tuned to the opening of Mozart&rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 21, this wonderful chime is happy and calming making it more appealing because of the cause it supports, autism awareness. Music therapists often use Mozart&rsquo;s music when working with people overcoming the challenges of autism and this fantastic chime serves as a reminder that music therapy continues to offer benefits for more and more individuals. Woodstock&rsquo;s inspiration for this chime came from uplifting stories shared by children with autism who love these chimes and can identify which Woodstock chime is ringing simply by hearing them play.

The design seen on the clapper of this musical chime has a special significance as the multi-coloured, interlocking puzzle piece has become an international symbol for autism. It represents the mystery and complexity of different abilities seen among people with autism and since every puzzle piece varies from the others in some way, the puzzle piece also symbolises the diversity of the individuals affected. The bright colours of the puzzle are said to represent hope and it is a vivid symbol of solidarity among those who promote and support autism awareness.

This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance with a specially-sized clapper so its soothing tones play more gently in the wind.

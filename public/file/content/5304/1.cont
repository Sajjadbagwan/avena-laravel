	<span style="font-size: 12px">These block pieces of agate look amazing and come in a variety of colours. They are sliced along the base creating a smooth flat surface which they stand on. The pieces have had one of the faces sliced and polished to show off the enriched colours and patterns inside the agate and the rest of the piece is left as natural stone. Agate was formed millions of years ago when hardened volcanic lava bubbles filled with enriched groundwater and created the wonderful patterns and colours. Agate is often sliced or cut and polished into many different shapes and sizes. As these are natural products no two pieces are exactly the same, giving you a unique piece. The average sizes of these pieces are around 6cm wide and 7cm tall but can vary in shape and pattern from the images shown.&nbsp;</span></p>

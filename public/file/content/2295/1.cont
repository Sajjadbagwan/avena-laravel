	A large wall plaque in a wooden triangular frame containing a canvas with a fantastic image of three wolves howling towards a night sky. The plaque then has feathers dangling from the bottom to add to the authentic look. A great looking addition to any wall and a wonderful gift idea. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filters down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams and these wolf designs are now our best sellers.&nbsp;The plaque itself measures 405mm tall and with the feathers is approximately 600mm tall.</p>

	This fantastic panda is powered by the solar panel positioned on the front of the base which powers the rocking motion. Our Kung Fu panda has his arms raised on his sides and leg lifted as if he were demonstrating a fighting technique by swaying side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get him moving, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not made as toys and are not suitable for children under 3 years of age due to small parts. Each panda comes in a clear cellophane bubble display and he is 10cm tall x 6cm wide.</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;">We welcome this adorable baby dragon hatching into the world and our dragon collection. George is a dragon who is most likely going to get up to mischief rather than cause mayhem!&nbsp;He has a fantastic expression on his face with his mouth open curiously, as he looks at his surroundings after hatching from his egg. This dragon is made from resin and finished in a grey stone effect with hints of yellow around his body that look fantastic. George the dragon would be happy to be kept indoors as he likes company like any youngster, but is also ideal to keep in the garden as he can stand all kinds of weather, although he may need bringing inside during severe frost or snow when he is unable to keep his toes warm and can&rsquo;t even muster a hiccup of fire for some heat. George is approximately 19cm tall and 20cm wide and is delivered snugly inside a card box and polystyrene to keep him safe during his flight to you and his new home.</span></p>

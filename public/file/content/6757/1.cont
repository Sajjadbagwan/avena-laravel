	Scorpio (23rd Oct - 22nd Nov) is magnetic, elusive, sexy and determined. That&rsquo;s you Scorpio! You were born under the eighth sign of the zodiac which is referred to by astrologers as a fixed water (ice) sign and in a lot of ways ice sums up your emotional character. The birthstone of Scorpio is turquoise howlite which is a beautiful turquoise colour with a natural stone pattern throughout. Howlite is said to eliminate rage and calm violent, uncontrolled anger. Turquoise howlite is believed to be good for teeth and bones. This gorgeous agogo pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their properties and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

	Our Indian incense cones are great quality and clean burning. At 25mm tall they are a large size compared to some and great value for 40 in a handy storage (and re-useable) glass jar, keeping the exotic fragrances as fresh as the day they were made and avoiding any air moisture ensuring a quality burn for each cone.</p>

	To use, simply light the tip of the cone with a lighter or taper, blow out the flame and allow the incense cone to smoulder and glow until releasing the smoke which is infused with the lovely scents, place the cone in an incense holder and enjoy the exotic aromas. &copy; Please do not copy text.

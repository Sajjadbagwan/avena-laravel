	Slip into your bathrobe of woven palm fronds and imagine a warm breeze and a turquoise ocean with palm fringed shores as you bathe in the luxury of pure frankincense and ylang ylang essential oils. Relax and unwind whilst the essential oils de-stress your emotions and blend together with a classic coconut heart and slightly woody base notes. This wonderful soap can be used like any normal bar of soap but is much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with or alternatively, rub the bar onto a sponge. This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being hand made the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This rather friendly looking Halloween hanger is made up of three wire loops with a yellow bow and an orange star that keeps the loops together. The loops are decorated with the wooden figures of an orange pumpkin, a white ghost and a black bat. This comical Halloween hanger would make a fantastic decoration hung anywhere around the home, by the mantelpiece, on a window, on a door knob or even on the front door. This delightful hanger would also make the perfect accessory attached to a Halloween costume. It measures approximately 21cm long including the fabric hanger on the top and is 12.5cm wide but the wire loops are adjustable to make the hanger longer. &copy; Please do not copy text.

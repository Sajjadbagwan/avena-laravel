<p>Natural deodorant bars are formed from Himalayan Salt created before humankind! They are 100% pure, natural and safe to use with only non toxic minerals creating the purest form of natural deodorant on the market. Ideal for teenagers, good for foot odour and athletes foot, great as an after shave rub to sooth and refresh, for hand odours such as onion, garlic or work related smells, can be used on cold sores and even insect bites. Most deodorants just mask body odour or work by blocking pores but the natural deodorant bar works by leaving a microscopic  layer or bacteria and fungal killing minerals on the skin which allow your body to perform naturally whilst eliminating body odours for up to 24 hours or until washed off. To use simply apply to underarms or area needed after washing while the skin is still wet or wet the bar and apply to dry skin. Natural deodorant bars are also very economical and this one bar can last up to 18 months after which it can be placed in a fridge and used as a fridge deodoriser.

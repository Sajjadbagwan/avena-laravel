	This fantastic candle is made in the popular owl shape for those who love these little creatures or just like the beauty of flickering candles. This owl candle is coloured pink with two great eyes wide open. According to ancient folklore in the West and also&nbsp;in the Indian horoscope, the owl is seen as a wise, silent and solitary bird of prey so it&nbsp;is the&nbsp;symbol of wisdom. It also represents the Greek goddess of wisdom, Athena, in Greek mythology. This lovely candle measures approx. 9cm tall and 5cm wide and&nbsp;makes a&nbsp;lovely gift.</p>

	This lovely Candy bath blaster will give you the feeling of stepping into a bath of warm milk, filled with indulgent sweet orange essential oil, seducing your senses into a truly sensuous experience. The Candy blaster has a lovely sweetness to it with hints of chocolate and mandarin&nbsp;over a floral/spicy base. You can use your bath blaster up to four times by dropping it in the bath and allowing a portion of it to melt. Your Candy blaster will fizz very softly releasing moisturising cocoa butter and essential oils. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your&nbsp;bath blaster&nbsp;to dissolve and remove it from the bath to save the rest for later. Wash any petals away after use to prevent accidental staining of the bath.&nbsp;This Candy bath blaster is also suitable for vegans.

	This fascinating black Buddha is sitting with crossed legs and palms held together bringing peace to all who are connected with it. The Buddha is made from resin and has been finished in a weathered paint effect and is suitable for use indoors or outdoors however we recommend it is not left out in an exposed position during severe frost or snow. Buddha translates to &#39;awakened one&#39;, therefore Buddha should be carefully placed in the home&nbsp;in order to mark respect for this honourable&nbsp;teacher. To obtain the best of your Buddha&#39;s philosophy of wakening to reality, he can be positioned in any room of the house, place of work or offices but avoid bathrooms,&nbsp;toilets and the floor. This laughing extra large Buddha measures approx. 47cm tall and is 29cm x 20cm wide and comes packaged in a card box for safe shipping. Please note, colour and pattern of weathering effect may vary slightly from the image shown.</p>

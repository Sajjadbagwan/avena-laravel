<p>These wonderful `Stress Balls` once placed in the hand and manipulated by the fingers help relieve stress and muscle tension. They stimulate the acupressure points in the hand, fingers and wrist as the muscles expand and contract rhythmically. Rolled in the hand they produce a soothing sound of chimes. Light weight black and red balls with copper outlined Yin Yang symbols and the Trigrams of the I Ching come in an elegant black box.</p>

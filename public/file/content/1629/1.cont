	Loose natural bath crystals can be used to create your own unique bathing experience by adding essential oils, colours, floral pieces etc. Our bath crystals are great quality, large and chunky (not the cheaper fine salt) and look great. Bathing in salt crystals stimulates circulation, hydrates the skin, increases moisture retention, promotes cellular regeneration, detoxifies the skin and helps heal dry, scaling irritated skin. May reduce inflammation of the muscles and joints, relax muscles and relieve pain and soreness. Note: only ever add oils if you are sure they are safe to use in the bath and to the correct dilution; please feel free to ask for advice. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	Tibetan aroma therapeutic incense is a blend of 31 natural aromatic herbs and spices as per ancient Buddhist scriptures. Soothing and never overpowering, Mistik burns with a delightfully clear and country fresh fragrance that both uplifts and settles the mind, body &amp; spirit. It was originally blended for meditation and now comes in this great triangular box. Each box of Mistik incense also contains a handy burner to place your incense in.</p>

	A stern looking and quite fearsome Diabolos figure sat deep in thought. A solid piece of great quality and measuring 18cm tall. He is packed in a polystyrene block and his own box for safe transit. Diabolos is the Greek word for &lsquo;devil&rsquo;. Diabolos actually means &quot;&quot;accuser&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;slanderer&quot;&quot; and could also be connected to the Greek word diabolous which means &quot;&quot;divider&quot;&quot; but eventually the general word Diabolos became the specific name of the entity. In the original Greek rendering, it was used to refer to the Christian Devil (The New Testament was written in Greek). Devil is actually the English translation of Diabolos. In Christian belief, this being is the embodiment of evil. The Devil originated as an angel who became corrupt and was cast out of Heaven as a fallen angel. His exile was the result of his pride (refusing to acknowledge and bow down to humanity) as well as the war he waged against God. He corrupts humanity and plagues the world with all manner of misfortunes: plagues, illnesses, war, strife, conflict, etc. The Devil has received many alternate epithets over the years: Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles (Mephisto), etc.</p>

It&rsquo;s handcrafted using only the best stainless steel so it will never tarnish or rust. This excellent spinner is an extraordinary decoration for any garden, patio, balcony or courtyard. Each time the wind blows, our fabulous wind spinner is there to greet it, taking your spirit for a joyful ride. This fascinating silver spinner comes packed flat but the steel circles can be opened up for a more mesmerising effect and the hole in the bottom of the spinner allows you to hook on new items. This wonderful wind spinner measures 27cm in diameter. Maintaining your mobile is simple, it only requires an occasional light wash with rust proof window or stainless steel cleanser.</p>

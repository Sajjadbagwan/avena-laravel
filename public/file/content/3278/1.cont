<p>A fantastic selection in colours of our small glass pebbles which come delivered by the kilo bag. These stones are ideal for many purposes including mosaics, fish tanks, floral decorations in vases and many arts and craft uses. They are a particularly great seller in our Skipton shop and children especially love to collect them. Each pebble is approx 2cm in diameter.</p>

	This cute dancing bulldog is one of the best-selling lines in our shop at the moment. On the front there is a solar panel, which powers the dancing motion. His arms move up and down as his hips sway from side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get him dancing, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not made as toys and are not suitable for children under 36 months old due to small parts. Each solar powered dog comes in a clear bubble display. He is 11.5cm tall x 10cm wide from one hand to the other.</p>

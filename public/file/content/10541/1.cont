	This stunning traditional orange and black dream catcher is made up of five hoops and decorated with orange and black string and feathers and finished with black beads. This fantastic dream catcher would make the perfect addition to any household especially at Halloween. This five-hoop dream catcher measures approximately 45cm from the hanger on the top to the bottom feather. The biggest hoop is 8cm, the medium hoop is 4.5cm and the smallest hoops are 3.5cm in diameter. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Orange &amp; Black Dream Catcher.</p>

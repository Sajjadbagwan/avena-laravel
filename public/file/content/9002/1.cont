	These fantastic carnelian mala beads &ndash; also known as Buddhist prayer beads &ndash; are a traditional tool used to count the number of times a mantra is recited, the number of breaths, or the number of times chanting Buddha&rsquo;s name whilst meditating. They are similar to other forms of prayer beads used in various world religions; however some call this tool the Buddhist rosary. Hindu tradition holds that the correct way to use a mala is with the right hand, with the thumb flicking one bead to the next, and with the mala draped over the middle finger. The index finger represents ego, the greatest impediment to self-realisation, so it is considered best avoided (as with the ego) when chanting on a mala. Carnelian is a wonderful deep red colour, thought to be a good balancer it connects you with your inner self, aiding good concentration. It is also said to benefit the kidneys, lungs and liver. On a mala, there are generally 108 beads, or some fraction of that number. The question often arises: why are there 108 beads on a mala? There are so many reasons that have been given for having 108 beads on a mala, however we may notice that 108 appears to be somewhat like a road map of reality in general, and the human in particular. &copy; Please do not copy text.

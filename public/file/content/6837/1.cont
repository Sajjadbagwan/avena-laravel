	Dear Sir</p>
<p>
	I came into your shop in Skipton recently with three friends, one of whom had used your O.S.T. Ointment for several years for a painful knee joint. My other friend and I bought jars for similar painful knees. After 24 hours use we now call this &lsquo;miracle ointment&rsquo;. To be relieved of pain and now finding walking and stairs a lot easier it is just such a relief.</p>
<p>
	Yours faithfully</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This bright yellow candle with orange and white hearts on the surface has a strong and sweet fragrance. This gorgeous candle is indulged with sweet, gourmand notes of sticky honey, orange and ripe peaches leading to a spicy floral centre of lilies, jasmine and ylang ylang. Creamy vanilla and musk balance the amber, sandalwood and cedarwood with vetivert essential oil and burn approximately 45 hours. When in use place the candle tin on a heat resistant surface. Ensure the candle is kept away from any flammable materials and do not move the candle while alight or while the wax is molten. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not leave a burning candle unattended. This candle is suitable for vegans.</span></p>

	A jar of 12 large Goloka backflow incense cones. The ideal way to cheaply buy a mix of fragrances that includes lavender, jasmine, Nag Champa, Palo Santo in a handy and reusable glass jar from Avena.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There are 12 assorted cones in each jar with a burning time of approx 20 minutes per cone. These incense cones can be used along with a backflow burner to create super impressive smoke flow displays.&nbsp;</p>

	Goloka have been creating quality incense for over 16 years and part of their proceeds are given to charitable causes that help to provide meals for underpriviledged children and providing vocational training and scholarships. Please note that it is normal for backflow cones to take up to 10 minutes to create a smoking/mist effect when used with a backflow burner. After burning backflow cones it is normal for a light oily residue to appear on the oil burner, for this reason we recommend protecting any furniture it is placed upon suitably. The residue can be easily wiped off the burner with a damp cloth. Please exercise caution when burning incense.</p>

	They show the spiral shell of the ammonite in great detail and it&rsquo;s amazing to think that these are from approximately 175 million years ago. Hildoceras ammonite fossils come from the Lower Jurassic Period. These creatures resembled the modern squid, but lived protected in their beautiful shells which are now fossilised giving us the chance to own a piece of history.&nbsp;</p>

	Each fossil measures an average of 3-5cm long and 3-5cm wide but due to being natural items the size and shape of each fossil may slightly vary from the image shown. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This eye-catching mirror box is made of composite wood, covered in fabric and lined with a velvet effect material with a velvet underside. The artwork shown on this charming box is a design by Anne Stokes. Moonlight streams through the branches at night in a magical forest where a white unicorn sits on the green grass projecting unnatural intelligence and calmness with a glowing horn as if it was the light coming from within. Against this graceful unicorn&rsquo;s side rests a young woman with chestnut hair while her long blue dress is flowing across the ground. A small sapphire is fixed in place on her forehead. The 7cm x 7cm wide mirror and the black velvet cover on the inside of the box make it a fantastic accessory to store jewellery, hair accessories or make-up etc. This lovely fairy and unicorn mirror box would make the perfect gift idea for someone who loves mythical creatures or would make the perfect addition to an existing Anne Stokes collection. The box measures 10cm x 10cm wide and comes in a decorative card box. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Blue Moon Mirror Box.</p>

<p>Chandan Dhoop is solid burning incense shaped into mini logs that slowly burn away creating a unique eastern aroma. Each box contains 16 logs and a silver disc to stand and burn them on. Chandan Dhoop incense logs burn exactly as cone or incense sticks, you simply light the top of the log until glowing and it will slowly burn down and create the unique eastern aroma you only get with Chandan Dhoop. Used in religious ceremonies and social functions in Hindu temples, churches, musjids &amp; agiaries, manufactured in Bombay since 1943 the packaging hasn''t changed much since even down to the card declaring the patronage of the Maharaja of Mysore. Great quality incense that is a little different.</p>

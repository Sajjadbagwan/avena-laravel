	Selenite or &lsquo;mineral gypsum&rsquo; is found on large salt plains and is created just beneath the surface. The word selenite comes from the Greek &lsquo;selenites&rsquo; meaning moon stone or moon rock. Gemstone hearts are cut and highly polished natural semi-precious stones and come in a wide range of shapes and varieties of stone. Each has their unique properties and are ideal to use as a worry stone, or for keeping in your hand, pocket or bag wherever you go, they can be placed under your pillow at night, used for meditation or chakra healing, simply as a way to collect some wonderful semi-precious stones or as an ideal gift idea they fit perfectly into our mini drawstring pouches. This selenite gemstone heart is approximately H6cm x W5cm and comes packaged in a plain black, reusable gift box measuring H2cm x W8.5cm. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

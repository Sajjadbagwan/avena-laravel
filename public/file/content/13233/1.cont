	This acorn wind bell mobile is made from cast metal and aluminium with a verdigris finish leaf clapper. Areas that sustain life are called habitats, and each habitat is part of an interconnected system that makes the richness of our life on Earth possible, this design incorporates some of our favourite animals that reminds us of nature&rsquo;s habitats. The art of casting metal has been around for thousands of years. When heated to extremely high temperatures, metal will reach a molten state and can be poured into a mould. In this way, the ancients were able to create items of both enormous utility and great beauty. The same basic processes are used in foundries today. This wonderful wind bell hangs at approximately 34cm long and would make a lovely gift for someone special. &copy; Please do not copy text.

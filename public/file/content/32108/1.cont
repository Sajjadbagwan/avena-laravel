	This lovely Bamboo windchime has several bamboo tubes in different lengths suspended from a coconut shell. As the breeze catches the windchime, the carved bamboo chimes knock together to create a distinct natural and relaxing sound. All of our Bamboo windchimes are ethically sourced, made from sustainable wood and sourced from Bali.</p>

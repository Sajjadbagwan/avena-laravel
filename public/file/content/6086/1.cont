	This handmade soap slice is simply iced water freshness locked into a bar with a whirlpool of quality essential oils and a fragrant scent. It is a lovely refreshing blast of oceanic fragrance, with lavender essential oil and a citrus top note of lime and bergamot. These soaps can be used like any normal bar of soap but they are much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with. Alternatively, rub the bar on a sponge. This soap slice is suitable for vegans.</p>

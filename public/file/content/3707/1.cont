	The classic outdoor wind chime with six metal tubes of assorted sizes giving a wonderful melodic tone as the breeze passes through them and not the dull or high pitched sounds you get with some wind chimes. The top of the chime and hanger are both quality dark wood and the chime comes ready assembled and packed in a long white box for safe transit and also making an ideal gift idea (especially a housewarming present). The soothing tones seem to have a calming effect on the senses and are thought by some to relieve stress and worry. Ethically traded&hellip;</p>

	Our supplier of this product is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. This finds its practical application in our dealings with their suppliers, customers and the environment. They give all their overseas suppliers a fair price, build real &amp; lasting connections with them, monitor fair wages &amp; good working conditions, minimise any environmental impact and use some of their profits to benefit the communities in which these products are made. An example of just one project is they recently donated &pound;5000 to rebuild Gejiadeng Primary School, a very old mountain school in Yunnan, which was in a dangerous state of disrepair. Building work on the school was completed in March 2008 providing the children with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a safe happy environment.</p>

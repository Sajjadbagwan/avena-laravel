	This eye catching paper weight is made of solid glass, formed in a hemisphere shape and has a velvet underside making it ideal to use as a paperweight. This art work is a design by Lisa Parker, showing a green-eyed tabby cat sitting on witch-craft books next to a crystal ball with the starlight night visible through the window in the background. This stunning paper weight comes in a foiled gift box which makes it the perfect gift idea for someone who is into cats or witch-craft designs or would make a great addition to an existing Lisa Parker collection. The paper weight measures 7.5cm in diameter and the gift box is 9cm x 4.5cm wide.</p>

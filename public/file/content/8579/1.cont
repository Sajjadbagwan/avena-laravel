	This lovely oil burner is a light shade of beige with a crackle effect which makes it an attractive decoration. This ceramic oil burner has been finished in a lovely gloss glaze. At the base it has a leaf cut-out design which looks great with a candle flickering from the inside especially in a dimly lit room with your favourite aromas slowly filling the air. The burner is good quality and would make the perfect gift for anyone on any occasion, especially if accompanied by a selection of our wonderful wax melts, simmering granules or fragrance oils. The oil burner measures approximately 8.5cm tall and 7cm wide. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Beige Leaf Cut Out Oil Burner.</p>

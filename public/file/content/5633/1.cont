	These slices of agate look amazing and come in a variety of colours. They are sliced to create a smooth, flat piece of this wonderful crystal with its natural rough texture around the outside. The slices have been polished to show off the enriched colours and patterns inside the agate. &nbsp;This pack of five agate slices is great value, colours may vary but we will send you five different ones and hand pick the best selection of slices for you. The average size of&nbsp;each slice&nbsp;is approximately 8cm x 4cm but may vary due to the shape it has been cut from. Agate was formed millions of years ago when hardened volcanic lava bubbles filled with enriched groundwater and&nbsp;created the wonderful patterns and colours. Agate is often sliced or cut and polished into many different shapes and sizes. As these are natural products no two pieces are exactly the same, giving you unique pieces.&nbsp;</p>

	Nag Champa is a perfume originally manufactured in the Hindu and Buddhist monasteries of India and Nepal. It is traditionally made from a sandalwood base, to which are added a variety of flower oils including that from the flower of the Champac tree. Each monastery had its own secret formula which is revealed to no-one outside the order. The sacred tree belongs to the magnolia family, its flower is yellow and star shaped, and as well as being the source of the perfume, it also gives a yellow dye. Frequently planted in temple grounds, the wood is used for making sacred images, drums etc. Nag Champa is a unique floral fragrance with musky overtones and is now one of the world&#39;s best-selling incense fragrances. Nag Champa dhoop sticks are sold by weight, each box contains 10g of incense, 10 sticks at 13cm long that normally burn for over an hour each. All our Nag Champa incense is the original Satya Agarbatti export quality (beware of imitations).</p>

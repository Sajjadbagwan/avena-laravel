	Arthur the Brave Knight is full of character. He would make a great gift to add to any fantasy collection or can even be the start of a collection himself. Arthur stands proud and fearless at 8cm tall and 4cm wide. He is wearing his coloured armour with his long cape draped perfectly over his shoulders. He has his iron head guard on with his hands placed palm down on the top of his sword ready for the battle to commence.&nbsp;</p>

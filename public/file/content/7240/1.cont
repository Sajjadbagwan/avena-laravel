	This variety pack contains three 5 inch smudge sticks made from sage and three different herbs. They have been bound together using 100% cotton and dried, ready to burn. Both of the sacred herbs used in each stick have been used for centuries by Native Americans. The varieties of scents are identified by the colour of cotton bounding them together. Your pack could contain; purple- sage only, red- sage and cedar, green- sage and sweet grass, yellow- sage and copal, blue- sage and lavender and brown- sage and pinon pine. Smudge sticks are known for their use in rituals or ceremonies to cleanse people, objects and places of negative energy. It is said that cleansing your house should be undertaken a couple of times a year, to clear negative energy that may have arrived. To use your smudge stick: light the tip and the blow it out (like you would an incense stick). Surround your body, the objects or a certain place you would like to cleanse with the smoke. Traditionally the ash is caught in a shell as this is also an ideal place to place an extinguished smudge stick. If you do not have a shell, a bowl would fine to hold underneath instead. To extinguish the stick smother the end (like you would a cigarette) but please be aware that the stick may continue to burn, so double check once smothered.</p>

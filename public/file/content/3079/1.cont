	Daffy the gargoyle has been formed in a detailed grotesque design finished with black and grey colours. This fantastic creature is sitting down with his knees pulled up to his body and with his feet placed on each other. He has his arms laid on his legs as he is pulling his mouth to the&nbsp;side with his thin finger. Daffy is looking up with his reddish eyes as someone has just made a joke&nbsp;about him and he&#39;s trying to say he does not care what anybody thinks. This gargoyle has his ears pulled down as he is angry and he has wings on his back with spikes running down between them. Daffy makes a fantastic ornament in a garden next to a plant pot as well as put in the house or conservatory by the fireplace or towards a collection. He is made of solid resin and is packed in a polystyrene tube for safe transit and&nbsp;put in a brown box. This ornament is heavier than it looks and is approx. 21cm x 23cm wide and 20cm tall. He would make the perfect gift for someone who likes or collects mystical creatures. &nbsp;</p>

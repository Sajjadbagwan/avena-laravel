	Blue goldstone is infused with sparkles and is thought to be a powerful energy generator. It is also said to be the gemstone of wisdom and science, helping us remember the light within the darkness and encouraging us to reach for the stars. This blue goldstone heart is approximately 4cm x 4cm in size and comes in a small pouch: black, pink or purple. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

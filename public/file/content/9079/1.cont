	This wonderful string of four star and a moon suncatchers is ideal to hang in any window to truly show off the colours and catch the light but will also look great on a wall or simply hung loose as a mobile. This stunning string of suncatchers is finished with small multi-coloured beads in-between the stars and the moon making it even more decorative. This piece measures 70cm long from the metal hanger to the lowest suncatcher. This suncatcher mobile is great quality and is hand made on the island of Bali. Ethically traded: our supplier of this product is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. This finds its practical application in their dealings with their suppliers, customers and the environment. They give all their overseas suppliers a fair price, build real and lasting connections with them, monitor fair wages and good working conditions, minimise any environmental impact and use some of their profits to benefit the communities in which these products are made. An example of just one project is that they donated &pound;5000 to rebuild Gejiadeng Primary School, a very old mountain school in Yunnan, which was in a dangerous state of disrepair. Building work on the school was completed in March 2008 providing the children with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a safe happy environment. &copy; Please do not copy text.

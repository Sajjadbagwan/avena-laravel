<p>This debut album by Shine is uplifting and inspirational. Soothing free-floating vocals angelically inspired, over layered sounds and mantras. The benefits of this album can be experienced through background listening or a more focussed meditative listening, or whilst practicing yoga or pilates. Tracks include: Relax And Let Go, Open Your Heart, I am The Stars, and the beautiful epic track - Going Home. Shine draw influences from Electronic music styles including ambient, down tempo and Balearic rhythms &amp; melodies entwined with strong vocal hooks. There are seven tracks conveying feelings of peace and positivity. Many of the tracks on this CD are recorded at the rate of a resting heartbeat to enhance deep feelings of relaxation. This album is fabulous for yoga, pilates and the many celebrations of mind body &amp; spirit.</p>

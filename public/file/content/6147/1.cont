	A large handmade dream catcher with chimes below, created with bright and beautiful rainbow colours. This is an eye-catching piece, with multi-coloured beads and tassels tied to either side of the dream catcher and a&nbsp;five tube, gentle sounding chime with a small dream catcher attached to hang from the bottom. The dream catcher chime measures 80cm long and 14cm wide at its widest point. Windhors<strong>e</strong>&nbsp;is inspired by Buddhist values and ethos. They build real&nbsp;and lasting connections with their suppliers and give all suppliers a fair price, whilst also monitoring fair wages&nbsp;and good working conditions.&nbsp;The business is owned by a charity, which donates money to social projects in the communities of our suppliers, and also to Buddhist projects around the world. An example of one of these projects is the support of an orphanage. &ldquo;We support the Ban Rom Sai Orphanage in northern Thailand, which provides a home to 30 children, including some who contracted HIV at birth. The home aims to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the children, and help them find a skill they are good at and enjoy.&rdquo; The orphanage was established in 1999 and is dedicated to providing a safe home for children aged 2-17 years of age. From the get-go the aim was not to just be an orphanage but more of a &lsquo;big family&rsquo; for the children. Through the commitment of staff and volunteers they achieved that. They work on a trial and error basis, working closely with the children and let them be actively involved in discussions and decisions about their lives.&nbsp;</p>

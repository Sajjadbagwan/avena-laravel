	This amazing looking wind spiral is completed with a green marble inset and hook. The spiral gives a fantastic illusion of the marble moving up and down as it spins. It is perfect for any setting and comes fully assembled, so you just need to choose the perfect spot for it to hang. The wind spiral is made from quality stainless steel that will not rust or tarnish whilst outside. To keep it maintained it may just require an occasional light wash with rust proof window or stainless steel cleanser. The spiral measures approximately 35cm long and does require a strong wind to turn fully but alternatively you could use a battery powered motor.</p>

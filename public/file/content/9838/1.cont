	This charming ladybird is lying on a bed of pure cocoa butter to envelop you into a skin-smoothing hug blended together with pure essential oils of clary sage and bergamot on top notes of delicate almond and subtle spicy cinnamon. To use, simply drop your bath blaster into a bath of warm water and watch as it fizzes, releasing its perfume and essential oils. Your bath blaster can be used more than once and is suitable for vegans. Rinse bath well after use.

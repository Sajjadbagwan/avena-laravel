	<span style="font-size: 12px;">This hedgehog has a fantastic cartoon look about it. He is round in shape with exaggerated features including an extended button nose, adorable big eyes, small round ears and cute smile. He has a very mischievous look to him, which you can&rsquo;t help but love. Made from quality resin he is suitable for outdoor use as part of our garden range (although we recommend that he is not left out during harsh, frosty weather and very bad winters) but he also makes a lovely indoors ornament and great gift idea for any hedgehog fan. He measures at 12cm tall and 16cm wide.</span></p>

	This decorative pestle and mortar is carved from onyx with a polished finish for a smooth touch and is great quality and quite a sturdy piece! The humble pestle and mortar is probably one of mankind&#39;s earliest innovations. Described as &#39;the original food processor&#39; the pestle and mortar were widely used in the prehistoric world. Neolithic/Bronze Age examples which have been found suggest they would have been used to crush and grind herbs, spices and seeds just as they are used in kitchens today. This gorgeous piece would make the perfect housewarming present or a gift for any occasion for someone who likes to spend time in the kitchen using dried herbs and spices. It would also make a stunning decoration placed anywhere in the kitchen. This decorative pestle and mortar measures 7cm tall and 7.5cm in diameter. Onyx forms in parallel bands with a variety of colours mainly greens and browns, and it is often used for carving. Please note that as onyx is a naturally formed product each piece may vary slightly in colour and pattern from the picture shown.</p>

	Olive oil (from Olea europaea) is extracted from the flesh of the fruit rather than the stone or &#39;kernel&#39; and is a cold pressed oil. The olives are first left to dry in the sun until they begin to ferment. They are then gently crushed, the stones are removed while still whole, then the flesh of the remaining fruits is used. The oil extracted in this way is then centrifuged and filtered. This relatively lengthy extraction process means that olive oil is also relatively expensive compared with other similar oils.</p>

	The name Winter in Venice comes from a young British entrepreneur&rsquo;s journey to Venice in the winter of 2005 on a soul-searching mission. She wanted to get to a place in her mind where she would be inspired emotionally and she found this in Venice where she had the inspiration to create a range of pamper gifts unlike any other. A few years on, and Winter in Venice has created a different, unusual, unique and truly gorgeous range of gifts. These gifts have a distinct difference in packaging, presentation, price and formulation that makes them perfect for every occasion. The beautiful fragrance of the orange blossom range creates a mesmerising after feel of pure indulgence that is also presented in a delightful mini bath tub. Smother your body with its thick rich moisturising body lotion or immerse your senses in a soothing warm bath&hellip; close your eyes and let your mind drift away through this fragrant garden. The wonderful contents of this gift set are: Shower Gel 225ml, Body Lotion 225ml, Bath Salts 200g, Body Butter 50ml, Bath Soap 125g and Body Puff.&nbsp;This fabulous accessory includes everything you need for a night in or perhaps to indulge yourself on a lazy Sunday morning. The beautifully presented mini bath tub that all these wonderful products are delivered in measures approximately 15cm tall x 25cm long and is ideal to use for storage.</p>

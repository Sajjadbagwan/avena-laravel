	There are many different types of massage techniques and each has its own qualities in terms of the benefits they bring to the body. Traditional Swedish and Thai massage are well known by many people in the UK but sports massage and shiatsu, a Japanese form of the art, are less well known &ndash; despite an ever growing popularity. It is worth bearing in mind the different forms of massage when you are thinking about the bodily benefits that it can bring. Nonetheless, there are some advantages that are common to nearly all types of massage.<br />
	<br />
	Massage improves circulation in terms of your blood flow and lymphatic system. It is often very closely associated with joint flexibility, which is an important part of certain types of sports massage as well as physiotherapy. Many forms of massage have a beneficial outcome for the skin and can assist with the repair to scar tissue, even that which has been caused by injury.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Many forms of massage also focus on muscular response and can be used to release chronic muscle tension and reduce physical tiredness, perhaps after over exertion. Muscle pain can be relieved as massage helps with both spasms and cramps. Massage studies have also shown that it also helps with the release and elimination of toxins in the body. Certain types of massage foster better breathing with deeper breaths being taken after a session. It also alleviates blood pressure in many people who receive it and can help with tension related problems such as headaches and eye strain.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	On top of the bodily response to a well conducted massage, it should not be overlooked that the practice has beneficial wellbeing effects too. These include the reduction of mental stress and the promotion of a clear mind. It can also cause a reduction an anxiety, for instance. Once the mind is more in balance with the body, ongoing massage sessions can really have a powerful effect on all round health.&nbsp;</div>

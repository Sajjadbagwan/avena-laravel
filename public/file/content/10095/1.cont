	This fantastic grape ornament is made of quality cast stone with a lot of attention to detail and finished with a solid metal hook moulded in the stone on the reverse making it ideal for hanging anywhere around the house or outdoors by adding a garden stake. This decorative cast stone sour grape measures H15cm x W9cm x L5.5cm and comes in a gift box making it the perfect gift idea for any occasion. These &lsquo;Carruth&rsquo; products are all hand made in Co. Mayo in Ireland and then shipped over to Avena in Skipton, North Yorkshire in their unique gift boxes. Each item is crafted from cast stone and all are solid pieces meaning the medium sized to bigger items do weigh more and are all top quality decorative pieces not the cheaper, resin, hollow type products hence the higher price. With these the quality and detail is fantastic on each and every piece. They are weather-proof and frost-proof so they can go outside looking great in any garden or hung from any wall but they are just as at home indoors, more often than not adding to a rustic country kitchen look. &copy; Please do not copy text.

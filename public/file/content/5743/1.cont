	This hand painted peach shaped soap looks amazing and smells divine. To many people the peach is the most tactile fruit and this peach is no different. From its slightly furry feel, wonderful shape, colouring and detail it couldn&rsquo;t get more realistic. It is obvious why it is an absolute favourite. These soaps are often used by many people purely for decoration as they look so fabulous and can simply be placed in rooms to release&nbsp;their fragrance and look pretty. As this soap comes presented in a lovely box it would also be great to give as a gift. As the soap is hand painted with harmless food colouring, before the first use of the soap rinse it under warm water for 2-3 minutes, gently rubbing off the colouring. Then your pure natural soap is ready to use. If it is just being used purely for its decorative effect, if kept away from humidity your soap will continue to look beautiful for many years.</p>

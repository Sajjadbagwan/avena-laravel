These cute mice figures are all made from solid resin, have great detail and are finished in bright realistic colours. They each have a unique pose with a different object and make a wonderful collection with fourteen in total. We can now (due to requests) also supply the whole set with this fantastic base of a cheese wedge on a cheese board. A truly wonderful and quite unique piece that looks amazing. The mice are all around 50mm tall and the base is a large solid piece that is 180mm tall and 330mm wide.

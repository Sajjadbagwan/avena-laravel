	This stunning round four-hooped traditional dream catcher is decorated with cream beads and red and blue feathers, making the dream catcher very pleasing to the eye. This lovely dream catcher measures approximately 30cm long from the hook to the bottom feather, the biggest hoop measures 7cm and the smaller ones measure 4cm in diameter. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Dream catchers are very popular with children suffering bad dreams. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	This quirky wooden word block is painted white and decorated with a pink love heart in the corner along with brown letters that read &lsquo;I love you more than chocolate&rsquo;. This humorous chocolate word block would make the perfect gift idea for someone special to show them how much love them or would be great to treat yourself to bring a little humour to your own home. It would make a great decoration put on a shelf, a mantelpiece or on the windowsill in any room throughout the home including bedrooms, living rooms and hallways or even in the kitchen. This lovely word block measures 4.5cm tall and 13cm long.&nbsp;</p>

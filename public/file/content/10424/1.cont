This wonderful bottle of fragrance oil smells and looks good, decorated with gingerbread men and love hearts it is the perfect addition to Christmas stockings or as part of a hamper and is ideal for use in oil burners, lamp rings, to drop onto potpourri or dried fruit to refresh a fading aroma. To use in oil burners fill the dish/well with water and add a few drops of oil; due to the quality of our oils 5-10 drops should suffice but you can add more for a stronger aroma.

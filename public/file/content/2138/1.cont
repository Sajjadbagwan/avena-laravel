	An assortment of four comical gargoyles makes this a brilliant set of the sturdy creatures. A gargoyle, also known as a &#39;grotesque&#39; in architectural terms serves as a gothic water spout usually seen on higher parts&nbsp;of a building or on roof gutters to throw water clear of walls or foundations but&nbsp;they have functioned solely as decorative pieces&nbsp;since the early 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. Originally the word comes from the French &#39;Gargouille&#39;, which means &#39;throat&#39;. &nbsp;These gargoyles are made of resin and finished in a cream weathered stone effect. As&nbsp;they&#39;re waterproof they are ideal to put in the garden or on a patio or windowsill but are just as&nbsp;at home&nbsp;indoors on a shelf, in the kids&#39; bedrooms or on the fireplace and are ideal Halloween decor. These gargoyles are approximately 4.5cm x 4cm each and come in a box of four.</p>

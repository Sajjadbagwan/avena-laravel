	Revitalise your senses with our gorgeous hand wash to leave skin feeling refreshed and fabulous. This luxurious hand wash is rich in essential oils including calming and sensual combinations of water lily, sweet orange and patchouli held together with deep undertones of black pepper and armoise. Winter in Venice is an award winning company that have produced a wonderful range of products to make you feel extra special. Using only the finest ingredients in their formulas, the natural extracts and essential oils are derived from the purest of sources from all over the world. They pride themselves in being one of the few toiletry manufactures that do not use parabens and all their products are SLS free. They do not test on animals and the products are all lovingly made in Britain. We find that people tend to think that quality costs more. Whilst this may be true in some cases, Winter in Venice believe that there is a lot more to this industry than making enormous profits and have developed a luxurious range of products with a realistic price tag. We decided to sell their products as they are a company that love what they do and we know you will too. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	A set of three different resin cherubs hearts on metal sticks. Ideal for plant pots or gardens but also often purchased for graves, memorials or remembrance use. Each cherub in this set has a different pose on top of an ivory coloured heart, one is resting his chin on both hands as if relaxed, one has just one hand on his chin as if thinking and the other has his finger to his lips as if asking for quiet. These are great quality pieces and ideal for indoor or outdoor use. The metal stick is quite solid and not flimsy, it will stick into quite hard ground without bending. Each cherub stick measures approximately 270mm long.</p>

	Selenite or &lsquo;mineral gypsum&rsquo; is found on large salt plains and created just beneath the surface. The word selenite comes from the Greek &lsquo;selenites&rsquo; meaning moon stone or moon rock. The selenite is said to have many healing properties and is shaped and sold in many forms including candle holders, decorative towers and palmstones. These palm stones are great as a decorative item or used as paperweights and make ideal gifts but are also very soothing to touch, play with using the hands whilst relaxing or watching TV, or for massage. They are approximately 6.5cm in length and are highly polished to give a wonderful smooth, cool and relaxing feel. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

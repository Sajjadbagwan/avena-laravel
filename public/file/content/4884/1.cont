	This fantastic piece of onyx has been carved into a brilliant hedgehog with lovely detail and rich colour. It has been carved with ridges down its back, a small hole on either side for its eyes and carvings to create feet. Onyx is formed over thousands of years, mostly in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains. Onyx forms in parallel bands of a variety of colours and is often used for carving. This stunning piece of onyx comes in a nice presentable gift box, but it is a thick piece of onyx so can also stand freely out of the box. It will complement anywhere it is placed within a house, also making a lovely feature on a mantelpiece or in a cabinet or simply just to adding to an on-going collection. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

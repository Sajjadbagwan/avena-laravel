	Fresh Linen is a light and airy fragrance that is very popular all year round and would make a fantastic housewarming present. This Ashleigh &amp; Burwood reed diffuser is a great natural way to fill your home with a scent you love. For those who do not like burning incense or who prefer to be more eco friendly than using plug-in room fresheners a reed diffuser is a modern, longer lasting&nbsp;and stylish way to fragrance a room. You can vary the amount of sticks used to adjust the strength of the aroma. Normal use, the liquid will last up to 4 months! Just place the rattan sticks in the diffuser and sit back while the fragrance is absorbed through the stick and evaporates across your room.</p>

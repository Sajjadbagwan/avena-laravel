	A beautiful polished agate candle holder cut from a wonderful looking smoky grey coloured stone and highly polished to create a smooth finish that really brings out the colour and pattern within the stone. The candle holder also has a felt lining on the base to protect any surface you may use it on from scratches etc. This piece is of a natural size meaning the colour and shape may vary from the image shown but&nbsp;being a&nbsp;unique item is part of their charm. The average size is 8cm x 8cm and 5cm tall with each weighing 500&ndash;600g.</p>

	A natural ointment specially blended for dogs and cats that contains tea tree essential oil which can be used on a wide range of problems such as minor cuts, grazes, scratches, itching, peeling skin, bites, stings or to deter insects. The tea tree plant has been used by Aborigines for thousands of years. Much has been written about its wonderful soothing and disinfecting properties. It is a natural insect repellent and has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties. Animal tea tree ointment is a great product to have around &#39;just in case&#39;. Note: this product can be used on cats but please note it does contain natural tea tree essential oil and some research shows that long term, daily use of tea tree products can in some cases be harmful (to cats only) and we don&#39;t suggest use on cats for any longer than two weeks at a time.</p>

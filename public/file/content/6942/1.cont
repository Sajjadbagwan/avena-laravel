	This lovely deck of tarot cards was created by the artist Antonio Lupatelli and Severino Baraldi who illustrate how the power of nature flows through harmony and wisdom. The druids - a caste of wise and religious guides who believed in reincarnation and a strong relationship with the forces of nature - were the leading representatives of the Celtic people. These pagan elements are combined here within the symbology of the Tarot. This fantastic deck of tarot cards features 78 divining tarot cards&nbsp;in the size of 44mm x 80mm making it the perfect tool to carry in your pocket and use whenever, wherever.</p>

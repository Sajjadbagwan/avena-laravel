	Taurus (21st April - 20th May) can be temperamental; you would probably use words such as &quot;cautious&quot;, &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;purposeful&quot;. One word you definitely wouldn&rsquo;t use is &quot;impulsive&quot;. When you are making important decisions in life, decisions about things that are vital to your security and the welfare of those you love, you spend a long time on them. You want those decisions to be rock solid. The birthstone of Taurus is rose quartz which is known as the &lsquo;love stone&rsquo; as it attracts love and supports the broken-hearted. It is said to aid peacefulness and calm in relationships and to ease stress and tension whilst also assisting sleep. This gorgeous agogo pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their properties and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

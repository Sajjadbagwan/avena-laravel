	This unique looking owl candle holder would make a fantastic addition to any place inside&nbsp;the house, especially on a windowsill, on top of a fireplace or as a centre piece for a table. The candle holder is made from metal with a silver finish.The owl is lovely and round with large glittery gold beady eyes and gold spots on its chest. It is sitting on a branch looking very sweet and wise with nest-like candle holders at either end. The holder measures 21cm tall, 30cm long and 10cm wide.</p>

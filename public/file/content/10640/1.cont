	Bronzite is said to be a protective, grounding mineral that is used to restore harmony and self-confidence in overwhelming and powerless situations. It is also said that bronzite inspires courtesy, and eases indecision and doubt. It is believed to be effective against curses or ill wishes. This bronzite heart is approximately 4cm x 4cm in size. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Bronzite Heart Large.</p>

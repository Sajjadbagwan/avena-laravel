<p>Bella is a beautiful &lsquo;butterfly winged fairy&rsquo; of outstanding quality with fantastic colour and detail. She is 105mm tall and comes in a beautiful gift box with information card and fairy poem unique to Bella: In the realm of all faerie, all creatures are close to the essence that is life. Most are changed with the duty of observing and guarding a particular species of flora and fauna. This has been the way since the ancient Gods of the Elements breathed life into the first fairy folk. None are more beautiful or graceful in flight than the children of the glade. For they share their wing formation directly with that of the gentlest of creatures, the butterfly. In our world they have watched over our development since we were pagans but then we lost the sight, by losing our faith and belief in all things faerie. Our thoughts turned to the world of science instead and to the eventual advance of technology, but the children of the glade never lost faith in any of us for they knew through ancient teachings, that the race of Adam would one day return their faith to Gaia, the mother of earth.</p>

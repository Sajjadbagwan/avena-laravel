	Tutankhamun head is beautifully finished in bright gold, blues, greens and reds, all colours associated with Egyptian imagery and stands 80mm tall. Tutankhamun is probably one of the most well known Egyptian names and images, however he was not one of the major players in Egypt in comparison to other Pharaohs. His father is said to be the Akhenhaten and his mother Kiya, although there is question whether either were in fact his parents but this is still a wonderful addition to any collection.</p>

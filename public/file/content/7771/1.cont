	This fascinating dream catcher shows a beautiful angel with her wings open as if she was ready to fly over the misty waters. She is turning her head to us as if she is saying that even when we cannot see her she will be watching over our dreams to offer protection. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filtering them down onto the sleeping person. It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams, this dream catcher is approx. 80cm long from the hook to the bottom feather and the actual picture has a diameter of approximately 32cm.

	Menthol crystals release a powerful vapour when added to hot water. The vapour can then be inhaled to relieve cold and flu symptoms, clear the sinuses or that blocked up feeling. Alternatively, they can be added to the water in your oil burner to give the whole room a clear and fresh aroma. These are great quality and powerful menthol crystals supplied in a large 30g size amber storage jar to prolong shelf-life. &copy; Please do not copy text.

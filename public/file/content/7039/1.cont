	This joyful sunflower would make a novelty and fun addition to any garden, patio, greenhouse, planter etc. At approximately 67cm tall this type of sunflower is the biggest we sell and would stand out well in any garden but they are&nbsp;also quite lightweight and not too top heavy for display in medium to larger plant pots and planters.&nbsp;This lovely sunflower has rosy cheeks, a red nose and a cheerful smile with two cute little bow ties with a flower in the centre of each. The garden sunflower is very well made and suitable for indoor and outdoor use but due to the nature of the product we would not recommend leaving it out in bad weather.</p>

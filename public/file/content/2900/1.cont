	These Tarot of the Old Path (The High Priestess II) are unopened and sealed, and the pack includes a book and 78 tarot cards. These tarot cards were created by the artist Sylvia Gainsford and the author Howard Rodway with the help of eight &#39;&#39;witches&#39;&#39; and representatives of the traditional Wicca Path. These 78 cards are designed with psychic insights using a modern approach to the magical Old Path, and an inspiring interpretation of how to stimulate and utilize inner intuitive forces.</p>

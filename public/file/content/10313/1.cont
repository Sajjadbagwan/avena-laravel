	These grey mice are made of resin with a lot of attention detail from their little hats to their tiny pointy noses and each one of them is accessorised with something different; one with a gift, one with a cute little snowman and one with a candy cane. These lovely Christmas mice would make the perfect decoration at the festive season kept as a group or dotted around on the windowsill, mantelpiece, shelf and table and would make a lovely gift idea on their own, as a set or as part of a bigger hamper. These decorative resin mice measure H3.5cm x W1.5cm x L3.5cm each. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Christmas Mice Set of Three.</p>

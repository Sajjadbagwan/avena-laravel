	This beautiful brass elephant has a lovely weight to it. It is decorated with the seven Chakra colours made up of glass beads. At the bottom of this handing decoration are 3 bells which sound lovely. This really would make a lovely decoration for inside or outside. Ideal for anyone who loves elephants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

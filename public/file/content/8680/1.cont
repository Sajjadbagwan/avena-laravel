	This eye catching paper weight is made of solid glass, formed in a hemisphere shape and has a velvet underside making it ideal to use as a paperweight. This art work is a design by Anne Stokes illustrating the Midnight Messenger who is wearing a white dress accessorised with a white cloak, gloves and a pentagram design tiara. This beautiful white witch is holding a lantern to supply light on this dark wintry night and travels in secret in a snow laden forest in the company of a wise white owl. This stunning paperweight comes in a foiled gift box which makes it the perfect gift idea for someone who is into owls or witch-craft designs or would make a great addition to an existing Anne Stokes collection. The paper weight measures 7.5cm in diameter and the gift box is 9cm x 4.5cm wide. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Paper Weight Midnight Messenger.</p>

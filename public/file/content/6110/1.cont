	This sensuous candle has a truly opulent floral-musky fragrance from luxurious accords of heliotrope and lilac blossoms, white violets and ylang ylang, enveloped in layers of velvety musks to vanilla and soft woods that infuse the base, and a sparkle of bergamot freshening the top. The candle will give you hours of burning time to enjoy the beautiful fragrance. When in use place the candle tin on a heat resistant surface and away from any draughts. Ensure the candle is kept away from any flammable materials and do not move the candle while alight or while the wax is molten. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not leave a burning candle unattended. This candle is suitable for vegans.</p>

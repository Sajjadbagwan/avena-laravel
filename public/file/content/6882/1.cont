	This fantastic three tier teak root bowl is hand carved using the natural shape of the teak root for that unique and abstract shape, therefore each product is a uniquely beautiful work of natural art. This lovely piece would make the perfect stand-alone, eye catching display or can be used as a functional display device such as a fruit bowl or to hold jewellery etc. Teak trees fell many years ago and instead of burning their roots, someone said &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t we make something interesting and useful out of them?&rsquo; and that is how a new industry was born producing carved teak root furniture. All our teak root bowls are hand-carved meaning the pattern and shade may vary slightly from bowl to bowl and differ from the image shown. This lovely teak three tier bowl is 50cm tall and each bowl is approximately 15cm x 14cm wide.</p>

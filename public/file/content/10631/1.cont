	Jasper is said to be an extremely nurturing stone and works in a subtle way to give slow and gentle healing. It is also a protective stone, protecting against depression and negative thinking. In addition, jasper is said to encourage a determination to succeed and to see ideas through into action. This Dalmatian jasper heart is approximately 4cm x 4cm in size. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

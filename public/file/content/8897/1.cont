	These stunning tins are decorated with two of Lisa Parker&rsquo;s fantastic designs; the larger tin is of the Spell Keeper Owl sitting on a crystal ball with a pentagram and with the night sky among leafless branches showing through the window behind the owl. The smaller tin has a decorative picture of a tabby cat with green eyes, sitting on a pile of witchcraft books with a fortune telling ball and a watch in front of it. These wonderfully decorated tins make ideal storage containers for biscuits, soaps, jewellery or any kind of knick knacks and would make a fabulous present for someone who is a lover of Lisa Parker&rsquo;s art work. The larger tin is 9cm tall and 19.5cm in diameter with the small tin sitting inside it measuring 8cm tall and 16.5cm in diameter. &copy; Please do not copy text.

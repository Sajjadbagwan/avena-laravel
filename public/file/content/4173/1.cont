	The Tarot Genovese reproduces a gaming tarot deck from the late nineteenth century. They are reproduced to be an 1887 deck which may look vaguely familiar to fans of historic decks since the artwork is not dissimilar to the so-called Soprafino decks currently available. However, what sets this deck apart from the others is that it has images which are double-ended. The effect of this is rather unnerving as it means that on first impression, the familiar scenes are randomly sliced in half and then duplicated in mirror image. It means that the Hanged Man, for example, depicts two pairs of legs, two pairs of tree trunks and not much else. The Tower has a slightly surreal, suspended double-ended tower, battlements at either end, creating a very odd effect, not to mention considerable impact. The Moon has two disembodied dog heads afloat in the middle of the card. It should be added that only the Majors and court cards are double-ended. The pips do not have that &ldquo;sliced in half&rdquo; effect. They are depicted in their entirety which means that although you cannot tell whether the Majors or court cards are reversed in a reading, you can tell if a card from the suit of Cups is. This deck could not, however, be used effectively for reversals. The backs of the cards would offer no clue either as they contain a very uniform, attractive, tightly-knit and unobtrusive geometric pattern in dark sepia which is non-reversible. This deck contains 78 cards.</p>

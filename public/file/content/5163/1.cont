	<span style="font-size: 12px">This fantastic mini dolphin is carved from onyx with a polished finish and smooth touch. The dolphin is free standing and stands upright on its tail making it 3.5cm tall. Onyx is formed over thousands of years, mostly in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains. An onyx forms in parallel bands with a variety of colours mainly greens and browns, and it is often used for carving.&nbsp;Please note that as onyx is a naturally formed product each piece may vary slightly in colour and pattern from the picture shown.</span></p>

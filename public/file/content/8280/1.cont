	On the front of this novel, dancing Mr Bean flip flap there is a solar panel which powers the dancing motion. His hips, with his arms resting on them, sway from side to side. Normal daylight and artificial fluorescent light will get him dancing, but to really get him going he likes strong direct sunlight. These items are not suitable for children under three years of age due to small parts. He comes packed and displayed in a clear acetate box for protection in the post and makes the perfect gift for an Mr Bean fan, or would look great dancing on your stereo, in your car or on the windowsill. He is 11cm tall x 5.5cm wide.</p>

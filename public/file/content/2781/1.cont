	Selenite or &lsquo;mineral gypsum&rsquo; is found on large salt plains and created just beneath the surface. The word selenite comes from the Greek &lsquo;selenites&rsquo; meaning moon stone or moon rock. The selenite is said to have many healing properties and is shaped and sold in many forms including candle holders, decorative towers and palmstones. These medium sized towers are one of our best sellers and as these are a natural product each piece is unique in shape and size. The approximate height is 6cm and theses are solid pieces that make a wonderful decoration. This is a natural rough stone product that is not cut to any exact dimensions, meaning the shape and size of the item can vary slightly from the picture shown as could the colour, shade and/or pattern where applicable. We always choose the best quality stone products from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

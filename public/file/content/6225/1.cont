	Plants have been used to improve health and promote well-being for thousands of years across the globe. Whether blended in herbal remedies to treat a host of conditions or eaten as part of a balanced diet to prevent illness, the power of natural plant materials to heal is well documented. Although modern pharmaceutical companies spend considerable amounts of time and money on researching the physiological effects of plants in order to isolate the active compounds within them which can then be synthetically produced and patented, this approach fails to take into consideration how the complex substances found in a single plant work together to promote health.</p>
<p>
	Artificially produced products such as cosmetics and skin care items may contain plant extracts, but may also be full of harsh non-organic ingredients which aren&rsquo;t kind to you or the environment. During the manufacturing process, valuable parts of the plant may be stripped away, including many of the health giving compounds which could be beneficial.</p>
<p>

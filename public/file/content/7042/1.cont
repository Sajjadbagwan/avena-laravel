	These charming mini sunflowers would make a novelty and fun addition to any garden, patio, greenhouse, planter etc. At approximately 21cm tall this type of sunflower blends in well in any garden and they&nbsp;are&nbsp;also quite lightweight so would make the perfect addition to any plant pots and planters.&nbsp;These lovely sunflowers have a charm about them, which is something to do with their cute smile, rosy cheeks and colourful clothes. These sunflowers have straw hands and feet and come attached to a wooden stick ready to place in and around the garden; they are very popular with adults and children alike. These joyful sunflowers on sticks come in a pack&nbsp;of three including one dressed in green, one in yellow and one in red. The garden sunflowers are very well made and suitable for indoor and outdoor use but due to the nature of the product we would not recommend leaving it out in bad weather.</p>

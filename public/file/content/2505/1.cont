	A single hoop beautiful multi coloured dream catcher. Multi coloured beads decorate the hoop and the web is a rainbow of bright colours. The hoop is decorated with traditional coloured feathers. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filters down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams. This dream catcher measures 16cm wide and 45cm long (including feathers).</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px">These fantastic little pebbles are a new and stylish way to fragrance any room, drawer, wardrobe, bag, workspace etc. and are a wonderful addition to any gift, gift basket or greetings card, giving the recipient a beautiful aroma but also a product that can be kept and re-used. The pebbles are crafted in various shapes from a porous stone that absorbs any fragrance or essential oil. They come ready fragranced which should last up to six months. You can then add your favourite oil or blend to refresh them by simply putting drops of your favourite oil onto each pebble meaning there&rsquo;s no fiddly refills or expensive top ups to buy. The oil is then absorbed and slowly released into the atmosphere creating a unique, long lasting and environmentally friendly freshness. The fragranced pebbles come packed in a lovely organza bag making an ideal and delicious smelling gift.</span></p>

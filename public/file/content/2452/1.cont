	This beautiful fairy named &lsquo;Memories&rsquo; is part of the Fairy Dreams collection and is fantastic in both colour and detail throughout from the blue strands of her hair to the detailed bits of snow on the toadstools at her feet. Holding a glass ball and sitting on a tree stump in a winter scene this is a very popular piece measuring approx 24cm tall. Each fairy is carefully packed in polystyrene and a &lsquo;Fairy Dreams&rsquo; gift box making an ideal addition to any collection or perfect gift idea.</p>

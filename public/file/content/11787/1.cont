	This ornate and beautifully carved incense burner is made entirely from wood, in a hexagonal shape with various tear drop patterns cut out of it, enabling the smoke to dance in mesmerising patterns as it escapes the incense tower. This tower comes apart at the base, revealing four small holes to put your incense sticks in, so you can mix and match scents and create your own unique concoctions of aromas, along with a metal circular tray at the centre for placing cones onto. This item would make a grand addition to any home that loves the luxury of burning incense, or equally would make the perfect gift idea.

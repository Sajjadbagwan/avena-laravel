	This fascinating collection of fossils is a wonderful starter kit for a budding enthusiast. They come in a great presentation box containing information cards for each fossil and a small magnifier to enhance detail&nbsp;and inspire an interest in evolution. Each set contains a cut and polished ammonite, a devil&rsquo;s toenail (gryphaea), fossil sea urchin, nautiloid, fossil shark tooth and magnifier. Fossils are remains of animals and plants that lived a very long time ago. When they died, their bones, shells, seeds and leaves were buried in mud or sand and over time slowly turned into stone. Fossils tell us which animals and plants lived at different times and how these evolved into the ones we see today.&nbsp;</p>

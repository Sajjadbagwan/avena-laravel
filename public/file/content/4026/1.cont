Made for the garden they can withstand the&nbsp;elements and are frost resistant but are just as happy indoors looking&nbsp;great on any shelf, desk, fireplace or getting interesting looks if&nbsp;placed smiling out of a window. They are great as a Valentine gift as a symbol of a kiss or used as a door stop, paperweight&nbsp;etc. They are a round granite type stone made from quality resin which is&nbsp;solid, sturdy and quite heavy. Set in the centre a pair of pink lips. The lips then have a zip attached around them! Why?&nbsp;We have no idea but love them or hate them they are selling fast. They are&nbsp;solid, durable and great quality making a fantastic and different gift&nbsp;idea as they now come in a fab gift box.</span></p>

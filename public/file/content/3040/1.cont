A famous Buddhist pagoda is situated in Shita Temple in Gaoxing Township of Qionglai County, Chengdu. The stone pagoda was built in 1169 of the Southern Song Dynasty, and the present pagoda retains its original features. The horizontal board above the door on the first storey still bears an inscription made in the Song Dynasty. One last point to remember is never to place a Buddha on the floor as this is disrespectful. It is said that by placing him in a raised position he will be able to bestow you with the strength to help beat day-to-day stress. This large Buddha is individually in its own box and stands 275mm tall making a lovely gift idea.

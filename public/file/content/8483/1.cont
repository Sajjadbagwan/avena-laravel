	These gruesome skulls are made with a lot of attention to detail from the hollow eyes, through the cracks to the life-like teeth, these skulls are indeed very decorative. The skulls are then decorated in four different ways, one with a rat crawling through the hollow eyes, one with a spider on top, one with a vicious snake wrapped around it and last but not least one with a scorpion. These resin skulls are then trapped in metal cages with a hanger on the top of each which makes these fantastic skulls the perfect decoration. These &lsquo;Captured Souls&rsquo; would make the perfect gift for someone who is a lover of gruesome decoration or would make great additions to an existing skull collection.

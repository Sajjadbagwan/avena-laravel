	<span style="font-size: 12px">This attractive hanging sign is made from wood.&nbsp;Each &lsquo;welcome&rsquo; letter is&nbsp;perfectly carved to smoothly join onto the next. A thin single piece of wood is attached to the front with the word &lsquo;friends&rsquo; on it. The sign is cream in colour with a stitching effect around the word &lsquo;welcome&rsquo; and&nbsp;deep red carved hearts, small buttons and swirly designs decorating it. It has a wire hanger so is easy to attach to walls, doors etc. around the house. It is an ideal decorative piece for any home and would make a great gift to give to friends. The sign measures 26cm x 15cm including wire hanger.&nbsp;</span></p>

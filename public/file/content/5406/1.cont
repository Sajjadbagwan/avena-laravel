	A lovely dream catcher with an image of a wondering wolf and an Indian Brave surrounded by spirit animals including an owl, lynx and another wolf. &nbsp;All set on a backdrop snow scene with a full moon appearing in the parting clouds. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filters down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams and these wolf designs are now our best sellers. This dream catcher is approximately 40cm long from the hook to the bottom feather.</p>

	<span style="font-size: 12px;">We welcome this adorable baby dragon hatching into the world and our dragon collection. George is a dragon who is most likely going to get up to mischief rather than cause mayhem! He has a lovely smile on his face, realising he has finally been able to crack out of his egg. This dragon is made from resin and finished in a grey stone effect with hints of yellow around his body that look fantastic. George the dragon would be happy to be kept indoors as he likes company like any youngster, but is also ideal to keep in the garden and can stand all kinds of weather, although he may need bringing inside during severe frost or snow when he is unable to keep his toes warm and can&rsquo;t even muster a hiccup of fire for some heat. George is approximately 16cm tall and 19cm wide and is delivered snugly inside a card box and polystyrene to keep him safe during his flight to you and his new home.</span></p>

	Reed diffusers are a fairly new invention to be introduced into the mainstream air freshener market, but a welcome one. Traditional air freshener products can have drawbacks. Their scent can have a synthetic or artificial quality, and sometimes their fragrance can be overpowering. A traditional air freshener may contain chemical ingredients, so it may not always be right for the consumer who wants to make an environmentally-friendly choice. These chemical ingredients may even have a harsh effect on the people and places where the synthetic air freshener is used.</p>

	Reed diffusers offer an infinitely more natural, subtle and contemporary alternative approach to home fragrance. The scent from a reed diffuser is delicate rather than artificial and a diffuser&rsquo;s fragrance will disperse through a room in a natural and gradual way. Simplicity is another benefit of a reed diffuser - it will not require a power supply like a plug-in air freshener, and will not require burning like incense.</p>

	Finally, diffuser oils are available in a wide variety of aromas that are inspired by the natural environment, and the fragrance from diffusion oils can bring a distinctive ambience to the home. For example, <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/Reed-Diffuser-Ocean-Breeze-200ml/">&#39;Ocean Breeze&#39;</a> has a scent that combines marine and citrus fragrances; <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/reed-diffuser-cinnamon-and-apple-200ml/">&#39;Cinnamon and Apple&#39;</a> has a warming and festive aroma; or try <a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/reed-diffuser-synergies-destress-geranium-lemon/">&#39;Geranium and Lemon&#39;</a> for a diffuser that creates a calming and relaxing atmosphere.</p>

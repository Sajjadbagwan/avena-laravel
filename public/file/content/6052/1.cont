	Compared to many spray air-fresheners, with their negative environmental impact, reed diffusers are a more ethical and effective choice. The reeds are made of sustainable materials and the oils need no propellent to do their work.</p>
<p>
	The reed diffuser is easier to manage than perfumed candles or incense sticks. There is no need to light the diffuser and this makes it is a safer option. Safety will be an important benefit if your household includes children. You will, of course, keep your diffuser well out of the reach of curious children.</p>

	Aerosol fresheners may give an immediate effect, but a reed diffuser delivers a steady and subtle fragrance which can last up to four months. Set it up, and then leave it to work its magic. But which one is best for you? Here are some ideas.</p>

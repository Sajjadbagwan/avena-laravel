	This sweet little owl ornament presents two owls positioned on a rectangular base quoting &lsquo;Our Friendship is a HOOT!&rsquo; The two very happy looking owls spread their wings apart and perched at angles as though dancing. Their eyes are shut and beaks open so also look to be singing with joy and it definitely looks like their friendship is a hoot. A lovely, cheery item of great quality that would bring a smile to anyone receiving it and a wonderful gift idea for anyone who is just a&nbsp;&lsquo;hoot&rsquo; to be friends with. This meaningful owl ornament is made from quality resin, decorated with attention to detail and measures 11cm long and 6.5cm tall.</p>

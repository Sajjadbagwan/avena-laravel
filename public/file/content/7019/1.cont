	This beautiful large tortoise is made out of resin. It is a fantastic ornament to put outside next to plant pots, a pond or just nestled between flowers, but also a wonderful decoration for inside the house or conservatory as well. It seems very realistic from its grey and green matte colours and all the little details on its skin and shell, to even the twinkle in his beady eyes. This tortoise measures 24cm long and 17cm wide. Why not also give as a gift to someone who loves nature`s little creatures?</p>

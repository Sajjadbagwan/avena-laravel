	With natural butters to deeply moisturise the whole body as well as a rich fruity fragrance laced with patchouli and geranium essential oils. Drop in for a seriously relaxing bath time experience.&nbsp;Use your bath tulip up to four times by dropping it in the bath and allowing a portion of it to melt. Your bath tulip will fizz very softly releasing moisturising cocoa butter and essential oils. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your tulip to dissolve and remove it from the bath to save the rest for later. Wash any petals away after use to prevent accidental staining of the bath.&nbsp;This bath tulip is also suitable for vegans.

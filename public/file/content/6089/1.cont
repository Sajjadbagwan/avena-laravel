	A stunning candle with a fresh and traditional fragrance, blended with notes of freshly plucked lavender and cooling eucalyptus. The heart of the candle features woodier notes of rosemary whilst the lavender theme continues, with the base being dry and musky. This candle will give you hours of burning time to enjoy the beautiful fragrance. When in use place the candle tin on a heat resistant surface. Ensure the candle is kept away from any flammable materials and do not move the candle while alight or while the wax is molten. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not leave a burning candle unattended. This candle is suitable for vegans.</p>

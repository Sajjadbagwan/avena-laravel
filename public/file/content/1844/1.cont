	This native wall plaque features a picture of an eagle&#39;s head with a dramatic landscape picture below it with two soaring eagles and then feathers and beads dangling gently from the base and sides as with a dream catcher.&nbsp;Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filters down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams. This lovely dream cathcer is approximately 60cm long from the hook to the bottom feather.</p>

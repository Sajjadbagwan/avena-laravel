	<strong>Nag Champa is a perfume originally manufactured in the Hindu and Buddhist monasteries of India and Nepal. It is traditionally made from a sandalwood base, to which are added a variety of flower oils including that from the flower of the Champac tree.&nbsp; All our Nag Champa incense is the original Satya Agarbatti export quality - beware of imitations!</strong></p>

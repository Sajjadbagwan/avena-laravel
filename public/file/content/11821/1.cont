	These cute bunnies are made with a lot of attention to detail from their brown fur to their little pink noses. These charming ornaments are made from quality polyresin making them ideal to place anywhere in the garden inbetween flowers, in or next to larger plant pots, on stone walls etc. This decorative set of rabbits would also make a cracking decoration indoors, placed on the windowsill, mantelpiece, shelf etc. This decorative pair of bunnies is frost resistant and winter should not be an issue but to prolong the appearance they can move indoors for the harsher months.

	These cheeky little bugs were created using fossils and have been finished with legs and wobbly eyes giving them a bit of personality. The fossils used to make these charming bugs include interesting specimens like brachiopods, crinoids, corals and clams etc. Each bug is presented in a clear gift case and they have all been given names such as Zebedee the Clam, Claudia the Coral etc. Fossils are remains of animals and plants that lived a very long time ago. When they died, their bones, shells, seeds and leaves were buried in mud or sand and over time slowly turned into stone. Fossils tell us which animals and plants lived at different times and how these evolved into the ones we see today. This fantastic set of five fossil bugs would make a cracking gift idea for someone who is a lover of fossils. The clear plastic cases measure L4cm x W3cm x H2cm. &copy; Please do not copy text.

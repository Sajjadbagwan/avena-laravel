	This lovely deck of tarot cards was created by the artist Severino Baraldi. The figures of the dragons seen on the tarot cards within this deck symbolise a primitive force and power that is present in the imagination of all civilisations, in different forms and representations. The iconography that recalls the four continents&nbsp;is interpreted in this deck with the myths of dragons. This fantastic deck of tarot cards features 78 cards&nbsp;in the size of 44mm x 80mm making it the perfect tool to carry in your pocket and use whenever, wherever.</p>

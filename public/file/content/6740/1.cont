	If you are fortunate enough to be born under the humanitarian zodiac sign of Aquarius (20th January - 18th February) you are ruled by electric and progressive Uranus making you forward thinking and self-directed. The birthstone of Aquarius is quartz which is an excellent channel for healing and good for the brain and soul by dispelling negativity and promoting clarity, focus and decision making. This gorgeous heart pendant is attached to a quality neck strap which is adjustable or can also be easily removed to carry the stone in your hand, pocket or bag as these are also often used as worry stones. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their properties and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece. Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

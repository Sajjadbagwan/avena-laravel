	This fantastic looking handmade soap is full of uplifting scents and rejuvenating pure essential oils to raise your spirits and help cleanse the mind and body. A dynamic bergamot fragrance with the typical fresh citrus character of the green fruit enhanced with a zesty splash of lemon, lime, grapefruit and mandarin. These soaps can be used like any normal bar of soap but they are much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with. Alternatively, rub the bar on a sponge. This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being handmade the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured.</p>

	A fantastic stoneware oil burner in the shape of a pair of hands. This great burner is finished in an earthy stone effect that is rough to the touch. The ceramic dish has a white inner glaze and is a very good size meaning you can fill it with your favourite oils or granules and relax without the worry of it burning dry every five minutes. The burner is 165mm tall meaning it&rsquo;s a good size and bigger than the average oil burner. A wonderful piece of great quality that would suit any home or make the ideal gift.</p>

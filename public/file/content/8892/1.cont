	These charming love hearts are hand-made of soapstone, coloured red and have the words &lsquo;I Love You&rsquo; along with small swirls and dots carved into them. These lovely hearts would help you make a nice little effort by giving them to someone special on Valentine&rsquo;s Day or for any other occasion. These fantastic soapstone hearts measure approximately 4cm x 4.5cm each and come packaged in a card gift box with clear plastic over the hearts making them visible without opening the box. How buying this item supports the WWF - our supplier gives a percentage from each sale to the WWF, which is covered in the trade price we pay them. The supplier then absorbs the royalties paid to WWF so we can still offer these beautiful hand-made and Fair Trade items to you at a good price. The more we sell the more we order and the more will then get donated. It is a great privilege for Avena to support such a well-respected and world-renowned conservation and environmental charity as the WWF and to help disadvantaged producers from across the developing world in order to assist them to trade out of poverty.

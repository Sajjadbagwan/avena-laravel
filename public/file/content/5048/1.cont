On the front there is a solar panel which powers the flip flap motion. The leaves move up and down and the central stem with a frog on it&nbsp; moves from side to side.

Each Flip Flap comes in a clear cellophane bubble display. Please note the colour of each base will vary from the photograph. At certain times due to low or uneven stock, not all colours may be available.</span></p>

	This lovely oil burner is a warm shade of dark brown that drifts into a lighter tone at the neck of the burner with a light brown well at the top creating a beautiful effect. This ceramic&nbsp;oil burner&nbsp;has been finished in a lovely gloss glaze. At the base it has a flower cut-out design which looks great with a candle flickering from the inside especially in a dimly lit room with your favourite aromas slowly filling the air. The burner is good quality and would make the perfect gift, especially if accompanied&nbsp;by a selection of our fragrance oils to get started. The oil burner measures approximately 7.5cm tall and 10cm wide.&nbsp;</p>

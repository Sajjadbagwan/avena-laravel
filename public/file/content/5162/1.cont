	Come along to the butterfly ball with a sweet floral and heady scent combined with cocoa and shea butters to whisk you away to a glamorous place. Enriched with pure jasmine and petitgrain essential oils that create aromas to uplift and calm your emotions, this bath tulip has a light refreshing fragrance with a delicate floral heart, also with a complement of star anise.&nbsp;Use your bath tulip up to four times by dropping it in the bath and allowing a portion of it to melt. Your bath tulip will fizz very softly releasing moisturising cocoa butter and softening the water. Rub the creamy foam into your skin while bathing. Remember to only allow a portion of your tulip to dissolve and remove it from the bath to save the rest for later. Wash any petals away after use to prevent accidental staining of the bath.&nbsp;See our full range of Bath Blasters, Cocoa Swirls, Bath Tulips, Whoopie Blasters and more by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avena.co.uk/bath-products/bath-bombs-melts/">HERE.</a></p>

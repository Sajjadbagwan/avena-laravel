	These are the highest quality charcoal tablets designed to quickly ignite and burn well even in damp or humid conditions (which some makes don&#39;t). The foil wrap keeps the charcoal tablets fresh and dry and ensures the&nbsp;highest quality. To use, position the charcoal tablet on a holder, plate or heat resistant surface and then place half a teaspoon of resin incense into the well. Using a match or lighter, light the side of the charcoal tablet, it will gradually smoulder around the rim on its own and slowly heat the pure incense within the well, which will simmer away filling the room with a beautiful aroma. Charcoal tablets are foil wrapped in tubes of ten.</p>

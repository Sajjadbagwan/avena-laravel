	Harry the Fearless Knight is full of character. He would make a great gift to add to any fantasy collection or can even be the start of a collection himself. Harry stands proud and fearless at 8cm tall and 5cm wide. He is wearing a coloured centre piece of armour over his torso with metal armour covering his arms and legs and a helmet protecting his head. Harry is stood in a defensive stance like he is already in battle with a member of the enemy. He has a very focused look up on his face and is waiting to take his next move so he is not defeated. He is leaning forward slightly with his head down and face covered. In his left hand he holds his decorated shield whilst his right hand has the sword attacking his enemy from under the shield so he is still guarded as he does so.</p>

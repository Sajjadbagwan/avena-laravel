	The name Winter in Venice comes from a young British entrepreneur&rsquo;s journey to Venice in the winter of 2005 on a soul-searching mission. She wanted to get to a place in her mind where she would be inspired emotionally and she found this in Venice where she had the inspiration to create a range of pamper gifts unlike any other. A few years on, and Winter in Venice has created a different, unusual, unique and truly gorgeous range of gifts. These gifts have a distinct difference in packaging, presentation, price and formulation that makes them perfect for every occasion. The beautiful fragrance of the vanilla berry range creates a mesmerising after feel of pure indulgence that is also presented delightfully in this hat box. Smother your body with its thick rich moisturising body lotion or immerse your senses in a soothing warm bath&hellip; close your eyes and let your mind drift away through this fragrant garden. The wonderful contents of this gift set are: Shower Gel 260ml, Body Lotion 260ml, Bubble Bath 260ml, Bath Pearls 200g, Body Brush, Wooden Body Massager, Back Scrubber and Slippers.&nbsp;The must-have suede hat box that all these wonderful products are delivered in measures 15cm tall x 26cm long and is ideal for filling with hats, scarves, jewellery or little mementos of yesterday.</p>

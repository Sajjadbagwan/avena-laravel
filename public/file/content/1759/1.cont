	This beautiful owl is made out of resin therefore it is water and frost resistant making it a perfect decoration of the garden. This lovely owl is turning his head on the side with its ears sticking up and his eyes wide open as he is carefully listening to something in the woods. Its beautiful colours, detailed design in its shape and feathers with the twinkle in his eyes make this wonderful owl more realistic. This delightful and colourful owl would look fantastic nestled between flowers or just put somewhere high as a guard in the garden as well as inside the house or conservatory. It is approx. 13cm wide and 14cm tall and would make a lovely gift to someone who loves nature`s little creatures.&nbsp;</p>

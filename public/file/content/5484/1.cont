	This festive fire side basket is decorated with red berries, twigs and pine cones and is filled with a large bag of pine cones richly scented with fragrant cinnamon and held together with a red tartan bow. This rustic basket would look stunning with the pine cones emptied from the cellophane bag by the fireplace, under the Christmas tree, by the front door or anywhere around the home and would make the perfect gift idea in a hamper. The fascinating smell of cinnamon scent will fill your home with spicy aromas which will surely be noticed by visitors entering your home. This gorgeous fragrance can be refilled with our cinnamon essential oil for that extra kick of aromas. These carefully picked pine cones can also be separated and dotted around the home or put on the Christmas table for that extra special touch. This decorative basket of cones measures approximately 30cm diameter and is 22cm tall.</p>

	This wonderful little box is a great way to burn incense cones. The hinged lid opens to reveal the brass burning well to sit your smoking incense cones in. You can then close the lid and place the box in any room. The smoke and fragrance escapes through the fretwork pattern within the lid. On the front and back of this box there is a gold elephant print with its trunk in the air representing good luck. It is a great idea and a very popular line. The incense box dimensions are 6cm tall, 5.5cm wide and 8cm long.</p>

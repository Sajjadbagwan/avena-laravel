	These bracelets are colourful, stylish and delicate looking. They are made from the cat&rsquo;s eye gemstone&nbsp;and hematite beads. &nbsp;The cat&#39;s eye beads are coloured with a holographic effect, whilst hematite is black and looks more like a metal then a mineral. &nbsp;Cat&#39;s eye is&nbsp;thought to dispel evil from your aura, bring happiness and serenity, along with optimism, generosity and confidence. It&nbsp;may also enhance creativity and kindness. Hematite, on the other hand, is known to strengthen determination and self-awareness, enhancing personal magnetism, will and courage. It is also believed to be beneficial for blood flow and for&nbsp;easing stress and nerves.&nbsp;We will send a selection of different colours when you select the set of&nbsp;five bracelets.</p>

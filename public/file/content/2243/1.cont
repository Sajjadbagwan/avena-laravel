	Grape seed oil is pressed from the seeds of various varieties of Vitis vinifera grapes, an abundant by-product of winemaking. The oil is then refined to produce a wonderfully light and highly moisturising oil.</p>

	Grape seed oil is rich in vitamin E and essential fatty acids. It contains more linoleic acid than most other carrier oils. Due to the high linoleic acid value of grape seed oil it is highly nourishing and light, making it ideal for use in skin care. The oil absorbs very quickly into the skin&#39;s pores which is why grape seed is an excellent and increasingly popular oil for a variety of skin care applications, massage oils and cream bases especially when used as a base carrier oil for adding essential oil fragrances.</p>
<p>
	Grape seed oil is a preferred cosmetic ingredient for damaged and stressed tissues because it possesses regenerative and restructuring qualities, which allow a better control of rehydration of the skin. Grape seed oil is also first choice for baby massage over sweet almond oil due the oil&#39;s nut content and we supply a couple of midwifery centres.</p>

	Aventurine is said to help to reinforce decisiveness and amplify leadership qualities. It is also said to be good for calming anxieties and fears. This stone is actually called Red Aventurine by the miners and the suppliers but it is a lot more peach in colour which is why we call it Peach Aventurine but all the properties are the same as the red as in essence it is the same product. Gemstone hearts are cut and highly polished natural semi-precious stones that come in a wide range of shapes and varieties of stone. Each has their unique properties and are ideal to use as a worry stone, keeping in your hand, pocket or bag wherever you go, they can be placed under your pillow at night, used for meditation or chakra healing, simply as a way to collect some wonderful semi-precious stones or as an ideal gift they fit perfectly into our mini drawstring pouches. This heart is our larger size measuring approximately 45mm wide and weighing around 60g. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text.

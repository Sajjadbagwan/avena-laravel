	Libra (23rd Sept &ndash; 22nd Oct) represents the element of air, or the intellect. You&rsquo;re most definitely a thinker - you like to use your mind to tackle problems. Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac, which refers to relationships of all sorts and your connection to the world around you. The birthstone of Libra is red jasper which is a very useful stone for controlling the emotions and for soothing the nerves. This stone is said to encourage vitality and well-being. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their properties and what they are associated with. All our pendants are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary slightly from stone to stone and differ from the image shown, giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

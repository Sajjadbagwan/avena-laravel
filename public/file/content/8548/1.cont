	An evocative and soothing album, Dream Catcher will calm you effortlessly into your own dream wonderland. The relaxing and slightly exotic sounds will allow you to slip peacefully into the realms of your subconscious. The mesmerising sounds of the beautiful pan-pipes will cradle you gently as you allow yourself to drift away knowing nothing negative will harm you as the dream catcher is there to safeguard you. This fantastic CD was created by Midori and has a 50:04 running time. This calming CD would make the perfect gift for someone who is struggling to drift off to sleep and would make a great tool with children who are having nightmares. Paired up with one of our wonderful dream catchers, this CD would make a fabulous gift.

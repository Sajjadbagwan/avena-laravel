	After a cold day there&rsquo;s nothing better than popping your chilly feet into a warmed up pair of soft and fluffy slipper boots. These fantastic boots are manufactured in a luxurious high quality fabric that is wonderfully soft to the touch. They&rsquo;re filled with a new and improved organic filling material with a hint of French Lavender. To heat, simply place in a microwave for two minutes. The soothing heat and a relaxing aroma is then slowly released, keeping your toes toasty and helping you to relax. Furry Boots are manufactured from the very highest quality materials. They make a fantastic gift and come in one free size (approx 3-7).</p>

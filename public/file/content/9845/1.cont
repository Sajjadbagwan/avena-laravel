	This shimmering Moonlight Waves chime is made with black finish ash wood and 34 satin green finish steel discs. This wonderful wind chime got its name from its curtain design of gently curved discs and is beautifully complemented by its welcoming and calming sound. The subtle variety of shadow and reflected light on the cascading discs is reminiscent of the shimmer of moonlight on water. Watching this unique wind chime flutter in the breeze recalls warm summer evenings and long walks along the shore. This chime has long strings that may tangle in strong winds. You may prefer to hang it in a sheltered area or indoors. This chime measures approximately 86cm long from the string that it hangs on to the lowest disc. &copy; Please do not copy text.

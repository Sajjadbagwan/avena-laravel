<p>This cheeky biker is made from fine resin and is designed in a cartoon / caricature style. He is wearing an old helmet with goggles strapped to them, his big nose and bushy moustache look great and his jeans are ripped, his black vest/jacket looks as if it''s blowing in the wind as he''s riding past giving a finger salute. The bike itself is red with flame effect paintwork. He comes carefully packed in his own box and would make a great gift. Height 14cms, Length 20cms. WAS &pound;14.99 NOW ONLY &pound;9.99!!</p>

	This brilliant cartoon-ish reindeer ornament is great to display in any house around the festive season, bringing character to anywhere it is placed. The reindeer is stood with his arms over two tree stumps one carved as the letter &rsquo;J&rsquo;&nbsp; and the other as the letter &rsquo;Y&rsquo;. The reindeer is the centre with the letter &lsquo;o&rsquo; around his neck to spell the word &lsquo;joy&rsquo;. The reindeer is very cute and slightly comical wearing his Christmas tree top, bow tie and big brown boots. He has large eyes, a button nose and a cheeky smile upon his face, with single stars decorating his antlers. This ornament is free-standing and very sturdy. It measures 18cm long and 15cm tall.</p>

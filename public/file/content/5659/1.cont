	This lovely Love Soaked Dreams soap slice is sensual and romantic with pure essential oils of an aphrodisiac&nbsp;nature that will make even Frankenstein feel frisky! Indulge yourself with the sensual blend of aromatics with a complex, sophisticated heart and warming undertones of sandalwood. This wonderful soap can be used like any normal bar of soap but is much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with or alternatively, rub the bar onto a sponge. This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being hand made the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured.</p>

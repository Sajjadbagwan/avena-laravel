	Aragonite is said to foster truth, understanding and an unclouded perception of reality. A wonderful stone for parents and people in tense relationships that test the nerves, aragonite relieves stress, emotional fatigue and anger, bringing patience when it is needed most. This highly polished egg is approximately 5cm tall; they sit nicely on our egg stands for display or are a perfect fit in our drawstring pouches for safe storage or for a gift. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we will be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash; Aragonite Brown Egg.</p>

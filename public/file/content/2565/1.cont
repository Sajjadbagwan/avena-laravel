	This mini square oil burner is delightful with its moon and stars cut outs. The colour of the oil burner is predominately blue which occasionally drifts into black. To use, simply place a tealight into the base and light carefully. Fill the oil well up to 2/3 full with water and then add a few of your favourite oil. Why not select an oil from our full range of essential &amp; fragrance oils! The oil burner stands approx 8cm tall.</p>

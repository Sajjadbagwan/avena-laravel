	This wonderful astrology tree clock is made with a lot of attention to detail from the roots at the bottom, through the leaves that decorate the body to the astrology signs on the clock. This clock is indeed a very decorative art work. The clock itself is sitting on top of a bare tree, decorated with a pentagram in the middle where the hands are placed. The inner circle of the clock is decorated with the eight neopagan sabbats, or holidays, which make up the wheel of the year. Decorated with more green leaves, the next circle of the clock shows the hours with Roman numerals and the twelve star signs in between every hour. This fantastic tree clock would make a fabulous gift for someone who is a lover of pagan crafts and would make a cracking decoration placed anywhere in the home. This eye catching clock measures 21cm tall, 20cm wide at the widest points and comes packaged in a card box with polystyrene for safe shipping. &copy; Please do not copy text.

	Daisy, the ladybird scarecrow, would make a novelty and fun addition to any garden, patio, greenhouse, planter etc. At approximately 67cm tall this type of ladybird scarecrow would stand out well in any garden but they are&nbsp;also quite lightweight and not too top heavy for display in medium to larger plant pots and planters.&nbsp;This lovely ladybird has a charm about it, which is something to do with its cute smile, rosy cheeks and colourful clothes. Daisy is wearing orange dungarees and a yellow shirt, completed with a lovely green hat, has straw hands and feet and comes attached to a bamboo cane ready to place in and around the garden. These scarecrows are very popular with adults and children alike. The garden ladybird scarecrow is very well made and suitable for indoor and outdoor use but due to the nature of the product we would not recommend leaving it out in bad weather.</p>

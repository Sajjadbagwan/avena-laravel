	Opalite is an all-round healing stone and is believed to stabilise mood swings and purify the blood and kidneys. It is also said that this stone maintains constancy and serenity. Opalite is the birthstone for Cancer (21st June - 20th July) and the symbol of faithful love. This lovely bracelet is made of carefully drilled solid gemstones which are smooth and highly polished with a strong elastic so one size fits all. This fantastic range of natural gemstone jewellery comes supplied on a header card with information about the stones, their qualities and what they are associated with. All our bracelets are made of solid natural stones meaning the colour, pattern or shade may vary from stone to stone and differ slightly from the image shown giving you your own unique piece.&nbsp;Please note that the black cord is NOT leather and so they are fine for animal lovers, vegetarians etc.</p>

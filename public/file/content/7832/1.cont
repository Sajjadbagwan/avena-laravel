	This beautiful palmstone is cut from green goldstone which is said to be the stone of courage and spiritual direction. It stimulates physical and spiritual energies and encourages poise. It&#39;s also said to be the stone of growth. Palmstones are the perfect way to ease stress and aid relaxation. Made from a wide range of natural semi-precious stones they are cut into an oval shape approximately 70mm long x 50mm wide. They are then highly polished making them a pleasurable shape and texture to hold. Each with their own unique properties, they are also ideal to place under your pillow at night, use for meditation or chakra healing; simply as a way to collect some wonderful semi-precious stones or as an ideal gift idea as they are perfect for slipping inside a greetings card or one of our drawstring pouches. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item please contact us and we would be happy to help.</p>

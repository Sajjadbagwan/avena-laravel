	This colourful handmade soap is an exotic cocktail of Brazilian lime and grapefruit essential oil that&rsquo;s so awakening it could make a three toed sloth shake his booty! A fresh fragrance reminiscent of a white wine spritzer, with citrus top notes making it ideal for a summer&#39;s evening. This wonderful soap can be used like any normal bar of soap but is much milder. Simply rub the bar repeatedly between wet hands until you form a lather to clean your skin with or alternatively, rub the bar onto a sponge. This soap is also suitable for vegans. Due to the soap being hand made the pattern in the soap may vary slightly from the one pictured.</p>

	This silver Pluto chime is made from a genuine hardwood with a bubinga wood and weather resistant finish with heavy duty coated nylon string, whilst the tubes are a special aluminium alloy that will not rust and come with a one-year warranty. The silver Pluto chime comes carefully packed in a lovely box making it an ideal gift. This chime is designed and handcrafted for superior musical performance. It is hand-tuned to a universal, pentatonic (five-note) scale and acts in concert with the wind to create random patterns of wonderful sound. Ideal for indoor or outdoor use these high quality chimes are relaxing and meditational. It is named after the outermost planet in our solar system, which was discovered in 1930, and reclassified as a &quot;dwarf planet&quot; in 2006 due to its size in relation to the elements in its orbit. However, nothing is dwarfed about the great sound of this chime. This wonderful wind chime hangs at approx. 65cm long.</p>

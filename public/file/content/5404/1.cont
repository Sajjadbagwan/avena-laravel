	A great dream catcher featuring a howling wolf at the forefront proudly standing on a large stone in a flowing river. Two other wolves look on in the background with a lovely scenic backdrop of mountains and fir trees. Dream catchers are based on the Native American tradition of hanging a symbolic web over a sleeping person to protect him or her from bad dreams. Hung above the dreamer, the dream catcher filters dreams from the night air, letting only the good dreams and important messages through into the feathers and then filters down onto the sleeping person. &nbsp;It then catches all bad dreams within the web. Very popular with children suffering bad dreams and these wolf designs are now our best sellers. This dream catcher is approximately 40cm long from the hook to the bottom feather.&nbsp;</p>

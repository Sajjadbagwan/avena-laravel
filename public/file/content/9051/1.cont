	George the dragon is the newest addition to our dragon collection and is by far the cutest. In a variety of poses, shapes and sizes George is a cheeky dragon with a comical look. He is more likely to get into mischief rather than cause complete mayhem! This cute George the dragon welcome sign is made from quality resin and finished in a grey stone effect with hints of yellow around the ornament that look fantastic. This fantastic ornament is happy to be kept indoors and likes company but is also ideal to keep in the garden and can stand all kinds of weather although it may need bringing inside during severe frost or snow when George is unable to keep his toes warm and can&rsquo;t even muster a hiccup of fire for some heat! This stunning welcome ornament would make the perfect addition to your home placed by the front door. This George the Dragon welcome ornament measures 30cm tall, 20 x 10cm wide and is delivered snugly inside a card box and polystyrene to keep it safe in the post to its new home. &copy; Please do not copy text.

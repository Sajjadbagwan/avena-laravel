	Selenite or &lsquo;mineral gypsum&rsquo; is found on large salt plains and is created just beneath the surface. The word selenite comes from the Greek &lsquo;selenites&rsquo; meaning moon stone or moon rock. This highly polished egg is approximately 4cm tall; they sit nicely on our egg stands for display or are a perfect fit in our drawstring pouches for safe storage or for a gift. This is a natural stone product and the shade and/or pattern can vary from stone to stone and from delivery to delivery. We always choose the best quality stones from reputable importers we have met and trust but can&rsquo;t photograph every piece as they come in and change them as they sell so we try to keep an image on the site that is a good example of that item. If you have any questions regarding a natural stone item, please contact us and we will be happy to help. &copy; Please do not copy text. Avena product description &ndash;Selenite Orange Egg.</p>

	This wonderful nativity set includes ten gorgeously crafted characters made of resin, decorated with wonderful designs and finished with a knitted effect. The set contains baby Jesus, Virgin Mary and Joseph along with an angel, the three kings, a shepherd with a lamb, a sheep and a donkey; almost telling the heart-warming story of the birth of Jesus just by looking at them. This charming collection would make a stunning addition to your Christmas decorations put by the mantelpiece, on a windowsill or a shelf and is a heart-felt remembrance of the celebration of Christmas. All the lovely pieces of this set stand separately so they can be displayed differently to the picture shown. The approximate height for each character is no taller than 8cm.</p>
